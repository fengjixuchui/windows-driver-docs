# Debug | Detach Debuggee


## <span id="ddk_debug_detach_debuggee_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_DEBUG_DETACH_DEBUGGEE_DBG"></span>


Click **Detach Debuggee** on the **Debug** menu to detach from the target application and leave it running.

Detaching from the target is supported under one of the following conditions:

-   You are debugging a running user-mode target.

-   You are noninvasively debugging a user-mode target.

If you are debugging a live target on Windows 2000, the **Detach Debuggee** command is not available, because this version of Windows does not support detaching from a target process.

For more information about how to exit the debugger or detach from the target, see [Ending a Debugging Session in WinDbg](ending-a-debugging-session-in-windbg.md).
