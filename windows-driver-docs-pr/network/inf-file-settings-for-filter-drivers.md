# INF File Settings for Filter Drivers





The filter driver INF file settings specify the characteristics of the filter driver. For example, filter drivers can be modifying or monitoring and can be mandatory or optional. The INF file also specifies general configuration parameters and other information to associate the filter driver with particular miniport adapters. Filter drivers are identified by a unique filter identification GUID (FID GUID).
