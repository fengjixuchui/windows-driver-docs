# Signature Score

This page describes the signature score for Windows drivers. Signature score is one of three scores comprised in a driver rank. Information on this page applies only to Windows Vista and later versions of the operating system.

A driver rank is formatted as 0x*SSGGTHHH*, where the value of 0x*SS*000000 is the signature score, the value of 0x00*GG*0000 is the [feature score](feature-score--windows-vista-and-later-.md), and the value of 0x0000*THHH* is the [identifier score](identifier-score--windows-vista-and-later-.md).

The signature score ranks a driver according to how the driver is signed, as follows:

-   Windows assigns the best signature score (lowest signature score value) to drivers that have a trusted signature. This includes the following:

    -   Premium WHQL signatures and standard WHQL signatures.
    -   Signatures for inbox drivers.
    -   Windows Sustained Engineering (Windows SE) signatures.
    -   A third-party signature using Authenticode technology.  Valid third-party signature types include the following:
        -   Drivers signed by using a code signing certificate from an Enterprise Certificate Authority (CA).
        -   Drivers signed by using a code signing certificate issued by a Class 3 CA.
        -   Drivers signed by using a code signing certificate created by the [**MakeCert Tool**](../devtest/makecert.md).
-   Windows assigns the second best signature score to [driver packages](driver-packages.md) that do not have a valid signature, but the driver is installed by an [**INF *DDInstall* section**](inf-ddinstall-section.md) that has an **.nt** platform extension.

    For more information about the **.nt** extension, see [Creating INF Files for Multiple Platforms and Operating Systems](creating-inf-files-for-multiple-platforms-and-operating-systems.md).

-   Windows assigns the third best signature score to driver packages that do not have a valid signature, and the driver is not installed by an INF *DDInstall* section that has an **.nt** platform extension.

-   Windows assigns the fourth and worst signature score (highest signature score value) to drivers that are not signed or whose signing state is unknown.
