# Digital Signatures and PnP Device Installation


This section describes how Plug and Play (PnP) device installation uses the [digital signature](digital-signatures.md) of a [driver package's](driver-packages.md)Â [catalog file](catalog-files.md) to verify the identity of the publisher of the driver package and to determine whether the driver package was altered after it was published.
