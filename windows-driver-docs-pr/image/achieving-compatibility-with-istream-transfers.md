# Achieving Compatibility with IStream Transfers


Because the WIA architecture changed to support **IStream**-based data transfers, drivers for Windows Vista and those for earlier operating systems can be quite different. You must take several steps to ensure compatibility for the drivers for Windows Vista and older applications.

This section includes:

[Internal Compatibility Layer](internal-compatibility-layer.md)

[Single Driver for Windows Vista and Windows XP](single-driver-for-windows-vista-and-windows-xp.md)

[WIA Driver Versioning](wia-driver-versioning.md)
