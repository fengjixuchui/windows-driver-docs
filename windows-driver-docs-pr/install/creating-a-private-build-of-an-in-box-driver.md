# Creating a Private Build of an Inbox Driver


When you build a private version of the inbox driver, and [Windows is configured to rank driver signatures equally](configuring-windows-to-rank-driver-signatures-equally.md), you must ensure that the private build outranks the Microsoft-signed version. The simplest way to ensure this is to update the value of the [**INF DriverVer directive**](inf-driverver-directive.md) in the [driver package's](driver-packages.md) INF file. The new value must specify a date and version that is later than the value of the **DriverVer** directive in the package's INF file that is installed on the target system.

You can automate the process for building a private version of an inbox driver that outranks the Microsoft-signed version by following these steps:

1. Modify the makefile to generate a new INF file for the [driver package](driver-packages.md). For example, add the following line to the *Makefile*:

   ```cpp
   $(O)\sample.inf
   ```

2. Add directives to the *Makefile* that will generate a new INF file and execute the [Stampinf](../devtest/stampinf.md) tool to time stamp the INF file. For example, the following code example shows how you can create and time stamp an INF file that is named *Sample.inf*:

   ```cpp
   $(O)\ sample.inf: $(_INX)\ sample.inx $(_LNG)\ sample.txt
       $(C_PREPROCESSOR_NAME) $(PREFLAGS) $(_LNG)\$(@B).txt > $(O)\$(@B).txt1
       copy /b $(_INX)\$(@B).inx+$(O)\$(@B).txt1 $@
       @del $(O)\$(@B).txt1
       stampinf -f sample.inf -d * -v * -c MyCatalogFile.cat
       $(TSBINPLACE_CMD)
   ```

   The following [Stampinf](../devtest/stampinf.md) command-line parameters are used in this example:

   - The -d \* parameter uses the current date as part of the DriverVer directive in the INF file.
   - The **-v \\*** parameter uses the current time for the version number. If the STAMPINF_VERSION environment variable is set, Stampinf uses the version number value that is specified by this environment variable.
   - The -**c** parameter specifies the name of the [catalog file](catalog-files.md) for the [driver package](driver-packages.md). This value is written to the **CatalogFile** directive of the [**INF Version section**](inf-version-section.md) of the generated IF file.

   **Note**  If you set the environment variable PRIVATE_DRIVER_PACKAGE, Stampinf uses the current date and version for the INF **DriverVer** directive. By setting this environment variable, you do not have to use the **-d** or **-v** parameters in your *Makefile*.

     

Once the driver is built, you must sign the [driver package](driver-packages.md) and must use the same [catalog file](catalog-files.md) that was specified in the **-c** parameter of [Stampinf](../devtest/stampinf.md) within your *Makefile*. To sign the driver package, follow the steps that are outlined in [Signing Drivers During Development and Test](./introduction-to-test-signing.md).
