# Sensor Driver Design Guide


This documentation describes how to write a device driver that interacts with the sensor and location platform in Windows. The Windows Driver Kit provides a basic sample, called the SensorsGeolocationDriverSample , to guide you through the first steps to implement a device driver for sensor hardware. In addition, the Windows Driver Kit provides a more complete sample, called the SensorsHIDClassDriver that demonstrates the code required to support actual hardware.

The topics in this section describe how to build drivers to enable your sensor device to work with the sensor and location platform in Windows.

This section includes the following topics:

[Getting Started](getting-started.md)

[Sensor Driver Overview](sensor-driver-overview.md)
