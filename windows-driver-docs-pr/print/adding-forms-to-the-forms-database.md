# Adding Forms to the Forms Database


If your printer supports additional forms, you can add them to your Unidrv printer driver by describing them in the GPD file for the printer driver. If you use a resource ID with the \*rcNameId field and a resource DLL for the form display name string, your driver will automatically use the new localization enhancements features that the Windows Vista Unidrv printer driver provides. Unidrv printer driver plug-ins also benefit from these changes to the spooler automatically and do not require any additional modifications. For more information about these enhancements, see [Changes to Printer Forms in Windows Vista](changes-to-printer-forms-in-windows-vista.md).

If you are not using a resource DLL for the localizable strings in the GPD file, you should remove the localizable strings, store them in a resource DLL, and replace the strings with the corresponding resource ID in the GPD file.

The following code example is an excerpt from a GPD file that uses a resource ID for the display name.

```GDL
*Feature: PaperSize
{
    *Option: Option2
    {
 *rcNameID: 259
        (form definition)
    }
    (other form definitions).
}
```

Inside the Unidrv printer driver that is provided with Windows Vista, the FORM\_INFO\_2 structure is populated by data that is read from the GPD file, as the following table shows. If the GPD file for your printer already contains the information that is required to fill in this structure, you do not need to change anything to use the new features that the Windows Vista Unidrv printer driver provides.

```cpp
typedef struct _FORM_INFO_2 { 
  DWORD    Flags; 
  LPTSTR   pName; 
  SIZEL    Size; 
  RECTL    ImageableArea;
  LPCSTR   pKeyword;
  DWORD    StringType;
  LPCTSTR  pMuiDll;
  DWORD    dwResourceId;
  LPCTSTR  pDisplayName;
  LANGID   wLangId; 
} FORM_INFO_2, *PFORM_INFO_2;
```
