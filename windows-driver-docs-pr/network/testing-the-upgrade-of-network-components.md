# Testing the Upgrade of Network Components





**Note**  Vendor-supplied network upgrades are not supported in Microsoft Windows XP (SP1 and later), Microsoft Windows Server 2003, and later operating systems.

 

There are two major steps involved in testing the upgrade of network components. These are described in the following topics:

[Setting Up the Test System](setting-up-the-test-system.md)

[Running the Upgrade Test and Examining the Results](running-the-upgrade-test-and-examining-the-results.md)
