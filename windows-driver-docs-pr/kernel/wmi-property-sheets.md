# WMI Property Sheets





A user-friendly driver allows users to control its settings through its **Device Manager** property sheet. See [Using Device Manager](../install/using-device-manager.md) for a description of Device Manager.

Drivers can automatically expose any WMI classes they implement on their property sheet by using the [WMI generic property page provider](wmi-generic-property-page-provider.md).

Drivers can enable certain controls on the **Power Management** tab of the **Device Manager** property sheet by supporting certain particular WMI class GUIDs. See [WMI and the Power Management Tab](wmi-and-the-power-management-tab.md) for details.
