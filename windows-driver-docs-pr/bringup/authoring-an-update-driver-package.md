# Authoring an update driver package


It is required that the update payload for each firmware resource described in the ESRT be bundled and distributed in its own driver package so as to allow it to maintain its own versioning scheme without being tied to other firmware resource updates that may not be updated at the same cadence.

The following example provides a sample driver package INF file definition for a firmware resource update that targets the {SYSTEM\_FIRMWARE} resource from the ESRT example in Table 2, updating it from version 1 to version 2. For reference purposes, let’s assume that the GUID assigned for the SYSTEM\_FIRMWARE resource is 6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a.

```INF
[Version]
Signature   = "$WINDOWS NT$"
Provider    = %Provider%
Class       = Firmware
ClassGuid   = {f2e7dd72-6468-4e36-b6f1-6488f42c1b52}
DriverVer   = 01/01/2012,2.0.0.0
CatalogFile = catalog.cat
PnpLockdown = 1

[Manufacturer]
%MfgName% = Firmware,NTarm

[Firmware.NTarm]
%FirmwareDesc% = Firmware_Install,UEFI\RES_{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a}

[Firmware_Install.NT]
CopyFiles = Firmware_CopyFiles

[Firmware_CopyFiles]
firmware.bin

[Firmware_Install.NT.Hw]
AddReg = Firmware_AddReg

[Firmware_AddReg]
HKR,,FirmwareId,,{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a}
HKR,,FirmwareVersion,%REG_DWORD%,0x00000002
HKR,,FirmwareFilename,,{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a}\firmware.bin

[SourceDisksNames]
1 = %DiskName%

[SourceDisksFiles]
firmware.bin = 1

[DestinationDirs]
DefaultDestDir = %DIRID_WINDOWS%,Firmware\{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a}

[Strings]
; localizable
Provider     = "Contoso Ltd."
MfgName      = "Fabrikam Inc."
FirmwareDesc = "Fabrikam System Firmware 2.0"
DiskName     = "Firmware Update"

; non-localizable
DIRID_WINDOWS = 10
REG_DWORD     = 0x00010001
```

Change the following sections to customize for your setup.

```INF
[Version]
DriverVer --> The date on which this driver package was authored; the Driver version of this driver package. Driver version in this driver package must be greater than the current driver version
CatalogFile --> Name of the catalog file

firmware.bin --> Change all instances of firmware.bin with the name of the firmware image name

[Manufacturer]
%MfgName% = Firmware,NTarm
[Firmware.NTarm] --> Change the architecture. 
For x86, it should be NTx86
For AMD64, it should be NTamd64

[Firmware.NTarm]
%FirmwareDesc% = Firmware_Install,UEFI\RES_{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a} --> The GUID of the firmware resource

[Firmware_AddReg]
HKR,,FirmwareId,,{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a} --> The GUID of the firmware resource
HKR,,FirmwareVersion,%REG_DWORD%,0x00000002 --> Version of the firmware for the update
HKR,,FirmwareFilename,,{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a}\firmware.bin --> The subdirectory named after the GUID of the firmware resource and the firmware image name

[DestinationDirs]
DefaultDestDir = %DIRID_WINDOWS%,Firmware\{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a} --> The full destination path for the firmware image file based under a subdirectory named after the GUID of the firmware resource within the %SystemRoot%\Firmware directory

[Strings]
; localizable
Modify any strings here [optional]
```

It is important to use a unique name for each firmware resource update image file version in order to avoid any potential collisions with other firmware image files, both your own and those from other firmware vendors. For example, *firmware.bin* from the above should be assigned the following name to satisfy both vendor name and version constraints: *Fabrikam-System-Firmware-2.0.bin*.

In order to ensure that variants of a given firmware resource update image, potentially used for OEM/IHV customization purposes, do not collide when deployed into the same Windows system image, it is recommended that each distinct firmware resource update image is maintained under a subdirectory within the %SystemRoot%\\Firmware directory. This subdirectory should be named after either the target firmware resource GUID. For example, the following firmware resource update image paths satisfy the deployment constraints: %SystemRoot%\\Firmware\\{6bd4efb9-23cc-4b4a-ac37-016517413e9a}\\Fabrikam-System-Firmware-2.0.bin.

## Test signing the firmware driver package


Once the driver package INF file and firmware payload binary are ready, the entire driver package must be signed in order to produce a catalog file. It is crucial that this catalog file vouch for the validity and authenticity of the INF file and firmware payload binary contained within the driver package in order to enable Windows to securely initiate a firmware resource update.

The steps to self-sign the driver package for test purposes are enumerated below. Please note that these steps are for test purposes only. In production, firmware update driver packages must be submitted to the Partner Center for signing. For the steps to sign a firmware driver package for production see [Certifying and signing the update package](certifying-and-signing-the-update-package.md).

1.  Install the latest Windows SDK and Windows Driver Kit. This will install the makecert, pvk2pfx inf2cat and signtool tools under %systemdir%\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\&lt;*version*&gt;\\bin\\x86.
2.  Run the following command to create a test certificate.

    ```console
    makecert.exe -r -pe -a sha256 -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 -n CN=Foo -sv fwu.pvk fwu.cer
    pvk2pfx.exe -pvk fwu.pvk -spc fwu.cer -pi <Password entered during makecert prompt> -spc fwu.cer -pfx fwu.pfx
    ```

    For more information, see [**MakeCert**](../devtest/makecert.md).

3.  Run the following command to create a catalog file.

    ```console
    Inf2Cat.exe /driver:"." /os:8_x64
    ```

    The */driver* argument points to the location where the INF is located. Change the value of the */os* argument depending on the OS for which the firmware driver package is intended for. For more information, see [**Inf2Cat**](../devtest/inf2cat.md).

    For more information about security catalogs and drivers, see [Catalog Files and Digital Signatures](../install/catalog-files.md) and [Creating a Catalog File for a PnP Driver Package](../install/creating-a-catalog-file-for-a-pnp-driver-package.md).

4.  Run the following command to sign the catalog file.

    ```console
    signtool sign /fd sha256 /f fwu.pfx /p <Password entered during makecert prompt> delta.cat
    ```

    For more information, see [**SignTool**](../devtest/signtool.md).

5.  Install the test certificate on the test system:
    1.  Double click on the fwu.cer file and choose the **Install Certificate** option.
    2.  Choose the following options during the certificate installation:
        -   For Store location, choose **Local Machine**.
        -   For Certificate Store, browse and select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.

6.  Disable secure boot in the firmware/BIOS options.
7.  Enable test signing in the BCD options so that the OS loader can load the firmware image file (firmware.bin) during boot even if the catalog is not production signed. Run the following command with administrator privileges:

    ```console
    bcdedit /set testsigning on
    ```

After the driver package is signed, it can be installed using one of the following mechanisms:

-   **Device Manager**. For manual testing, Device Manager provides a friendly interface for locating a firmware resource device and updating its driver in order to initiate a firmware resource update.
    1.  Locate the desired firmware resource device under the “Firmware” class while viewing devices by type, or under the “Microsoft UEFI-Compliant System” device while viewing devices by connection.
    2.  Right-click on the firmware resource device and select the “Update Driver Software...” option.
    3.  Use the “Browse my computer for driver software” option to locate and install a newer firmware resource update driver package onto the firmware resource device. This operation will ensure that the specified firmware resource update driver package is in fact newer than any existing firmware resource update driver package that might already be on the firmware resource device before adding it to the Windows Driver Store and initiating an installation.
-   **pnputil**. For automated testing, the pnputil command line utility can be used from an Administrator-elevated command prompt to import a firmware resource update driver package into the Windows Driver Store and initiate a device installation on any/all applicable firmware resource devices that are presently using an older firmware resource version, as established by the DriverVer of their currently installed driver package INF file or a lack of a 3rd party supplied driver package INF file altogether. For example, use the following command line to add and install X:\\firmware.inf:

    ```console
    pnputil -i -a X:\firmware.inf
    ```

    **Note**  The pnputil tool is not supported on Windows 10 Mobile.



If the firmware resource update was successfully installed on a firmware resource device and it supplies a firmware resource update that is a higher version than the current firmware version, then the device will be awaiting a system reboot in order to complete the update operation. A device in this state will indicate its need for the system to be rebooted by maintaining a device problem, which prevents the device from being started and restored to a steady state until the reboot is performed.

## Validating the status of the firmware update


When a firmware driver package is successfully installed, PnP will request a system reboot to apply the updates. Post reboot, the status of the update can be validated. The status of the update is maintained under the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FirmwareResources\\{RESOURCE\_GUID}.

RESOURCE\_GUID is the GUID of the resource (from ESRT) that was updated.

The “LastAttemptStatus” registry value indicates the status of the firmware update, where a value of 0 indicates success and any non-zero value represents a failure. The value for this registry key are NTSTATUS codes populated by OS Loader based upon the value of the LastAttemptStatus from the ESRT. The following table maps the LastAttemptStatus code to its corresponding NTSTATUS code.

| LastAttemptStatus                        | Code | NTSTATUS                        | Code       |
|------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------|------------|
| Success                                  | 0    | STATUS\_SUCCESS                 | 0x00000000 |
| Error: Unsuccessful                      | 1    | STATUS\_UNSUCCESSFUL            | 0xC0000001 |
| Error: Insufficient Resources            | 2    | STATUS\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES | 0xC000009A |
| Error: Incorrect Version                 | 3    | STATUS\_REVISION\_MISMATCH      | 0xC0000059 |
| Error: Invalid Image Format              | 4    | STATUS\_INVALID\_IMAGE\_FORMAT  | 0xC000007B |
| Error: Authentication Error              | 5    | STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED          | 0xC0000022 |
| Error: Power Event, AC Not Connected     | 6    | STATUS\_POWER\_STATE\_INVALID   | 0xC00002D3 |
| Error: Power Event, Insufficient Battery | 7    | STATUS\_INSUFFICIENT\_POWER     | 0xC00002DE |



The Hardware ID property of the firmware resource device node should also reflect the change in the firmware version, where XXX is the new firmware version.

-   UEFI\\RES\_{RESOURCE\_GUID}&REV\_XXX

If the firmware update failed, you can retry the failed firmware update:

-   In Device Manager, expand the Firmware node, right-click the firmware resource device, and click **Update Driver Software**.
-   Click **Browse my computer for driver software**, and on the next page click **Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer**.
-   Select the same driver that you installed previously, and click OK.

After the next reboot, the OS Loader will call into UpdateCapsule() with the payload of the firmware driver package.
