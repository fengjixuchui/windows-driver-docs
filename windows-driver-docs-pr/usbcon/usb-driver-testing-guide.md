<td><p>The Microsoft USB Test Tool (MUTT) is collection of devices for testing interoperability of your USB hardware with the Microsoft USB driver stack. This section provides a brief overview of the different types of MUTT devices, the tests you can run by using the device, and suggests topologies for controller, hub, device, and BIOS/UEFI testing.</p>
<p>To communicate with MUTT devices, you need the MUTT software package. This package contains several test tools and drivers that let hardware test engineers test interoperability of their USB controller or hub with the Microsoft USB driver stack. The test tools validate USB host controller software, hardware (including firmware) and any USB hub that is installed between the host controller and the device.</p></td>

<p>Stress and transfer tests are geared towards saturating the bus protocol and the host controller software. These tests perform several simultaneous I/O transfers and cancellations to the MUTT device. The MUTT firmware is programmed to fail transfers during these tests. These failures emulate error conditions that the controller or USB driver stack are exposed to under stressful USB conditions.</p></td>
