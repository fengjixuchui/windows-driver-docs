# About Contexts





Much of the information that is passed between the WIA service, a WIA minidriver, and a WIA device is in the form of a context of one kind or another. These can be WIA service contexts (also known as application item contexts), property contexts, transfer contexts, or device-specific contexts. Each type of context is discussed in the following topics in this section:

[Application Item Contexts](application-item-contexts.md)

[Property Contexts](property-contexts.md)

[Transfer Contexts](transfer-contexts.md)

[Device-Specific Contexts](device-specific-contexts.md)
