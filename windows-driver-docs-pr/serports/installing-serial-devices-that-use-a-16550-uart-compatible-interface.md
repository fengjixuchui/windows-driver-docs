# Installing Serial Devices that Use a 16550 UART-Compatible Interface

To install a Plug and Play device that uses Serial as a lower-level device filter driver, do the following:

- Specify Serial as a lower-level device filter driver in the device's INF file -- see [Installing a Filter Driver](../install/installing-a-filter-driver.md).

- Set the **SerialSkipExternalNaming** entry value for the device to a nonzero value -- see [Registry Settings for a Plug and Play Serial Device](registry-settings-for-a-plug-and-play-serial-device.md).
