# LowerLogoVersion


**LowerLogoVersion** is a [device setup class property](/previous-versions/ff542239(v=vs.85)) that affects the signature score of a driver as follows:

-   Windows assigns the best signature score to drivers that have a WHQL signature for a Windows version that is the same or later than the **LowerLogoVersion** value.

-   Windows assigns the next best signature score to a driver that was signed by a third-party using Authenticode technology and to a driver that has a WHQL signature for a Windows version earlier than the **LowerLogoVersion** value.

A **LowerLogoVersion** value is a NULL-terminated string that specifies the Windows version, as indicated in the following table.

The system default **LowerLogoVersion** value for a system-defined [device setup class](./overview-of-device-setup-classes.md) is "5.1." This means that drivers that have a WHQL signature for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP have the same signature score as a driver that is signed by Microsoft for Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.
