# Indicating Chimney-Related Events


\[The TCP chimney offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]

An offload target indicates the following types of chimney-related events:

-   Events that pertain to chimneys in general. For more information about such indications, see [Making a NeighborReachabilityQuery Indication](making-a-neighborreachabilityquery-indication.md). At present, the only supported chimney type is the TCP chimney.

-   Events that are TCP chimney-specific. For more information about indicating these events, see [Indicating TCP Chimney-Specific Events](indicating-tcp-chimney-specific-events.md).
