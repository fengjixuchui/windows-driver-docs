# The driver sample file list


The following source files are in the src\\SPB\\SpbAccelerometer folder and are used to build the SpbAccelerometer.sys and SpbAccelerometer.inf files.

**File**: Description

**AccelerometerDevice.cpp**: Device-level methods to configure sensor, set properties, and query data.

**Adxl345.h**: Device's register set definition and defines

**ClientManager.cpp**: Implements the driver's client tracking logic, including arbitration of settable properties.

**Device.cpp**: WDF PnP event callbacks and helper methods

**DllMain.cpp**: Driver's entry point and exported functions for providing COM support

**Driver.cpp**: WDF driver entry event callbacks and helper methods

**Internal.h**: Common includes

**makefile.inc**: Defines custom build actions. Includes the conversion of the .INX file into a .INF file.

**Queue.cpp**: Implementation of IQueueCallbackDeviceIoControl.

**ReportManager.cpp**: Maintains the driver's report interval.

**Request.idl**: Defines the request interface for communicating with the sensor device.

**SensorDdi.cpp**: Implementation of the sensor driver callback interface, ISensorDriver.

**SensorDevice.idl**: Defines the interface between the sensor DDI and the sensor device implementations.

**sources**: Lists source files and build options

**sources.dep**: Defines build dependencies

**SpbAccelerometer.asl**: Sample ASL file for a peripheral device node. It declares I2C and GPIO interrupt resources. Note that each macro specifies an ACPI path to describe direct dependencies.

**SpbAccelerometer.ctl**: Declaration of driver's tracing GUID

**SpbAccelerometer.def**: Declaration of exported functions for providing COM support

**SpbAccelerometer.idl**: Driver's library interface file

**SpbAccelerometer.inx**: Describes the installation of the driver. The build process converts this into a .INF.

**SpbAccelerometer.rc**: Resource file

**SpbRequest.cpp**: Implementation of register-based device accesses via SPB.

**Trace.h**: Sets up WPP tracing.
