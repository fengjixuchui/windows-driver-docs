# Using SetupAPI to Access Device Properties


In WindowsÂ Vista and later versions of Windows, the SetupAPI property functions can be used to access the properties of device instances, device classes, and device interfaces. For information about how to use these property functions to access the [system-defined device properties](system-defined-device-properties2.md), see the following topics:

[Accessing Device Instance Properties](accessing-device-instance-properties--windows-vista-and-later-.md)

[Accessing Device Class Properties](accessing-device-class-properties--windows-vista-and-later-.md)

[Accessing Device Interface Properties](accessing-device-interface-properties--windows-vista-and-later-.md)

For information about how to access device properties on Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000, see [Using SetupAPI and Configuration Manager to Access Device Properties](using-setupapi-and-configuration-manager-to-access-device-properties.md).
