# Porting Task Offload Services to NDIS 6.0





NDIS TCP/IP offload services enable the offloading of network data processing to offload-capable network interface cards (NICs). NDIS 6.0 supports two categories of TCP/IP offload services: task offload services that are enhanced forms of the NDIS 5.1 and earlier task offload services, and connection offload services. This section describes NDIS 5.1-to-NDIS 6.0 task offload porting issues and describes NDIS 6.0 support for configuring TCP/IP offload services.
