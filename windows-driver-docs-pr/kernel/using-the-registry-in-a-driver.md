# Using the Registry in a Driver





Drivers, like other system components, rely on the registry to store configuration information. The system itself uses the registry to store information about devices and drivers, and a driver can store additional information there for its own use.

The Microsoft Windows executive provides the following two sets of routines for manipulating the registry:

[Registry Key Object Routines](registry-key-object-routines.md)

[Registry Run-Time Library Routines](registry-run-time-library-routines.md)

[Plug and Play Registry Routines](plug-and-play-registry-routines.md)

For additional information about the registry, see:

[**INF AddReg Directive**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-addreg-directive)

[Registry Keys for Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/overview-of-registry-trees-and-keys)
