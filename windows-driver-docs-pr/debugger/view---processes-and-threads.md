Select **Processes and Threads** on the **View** menu to open the [Processes and Threads window](processes-and-threads-window.md). If this window is already open, it becomes active.

This command is equivalent to pressing ALT+9 or selecting the **Processes and Threads (Alt+9)** button (![screen shot of the processes and threads button](images/window-processes-threads.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Processes and Threads Window](processes-and-threads-window.md).
