# Add or Update a code signing certificate

As a Partner Center administrator, you’re responsible for keeping your digital certificate information up to date. When the original certificate expires, you’ll need to get a new certificate and upload a new file signed with your new digital certificate.

Partner Center supports multiple certificates associated with a single account.  If you want to add additional certificates using this same process.

If you’re registering your company on dashboard for the first time, see [Get started with the hardware dashboard program](get-started-with-the-hardware-dashboard.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The certificate uploaded and used for all Partner Center submission packages has changed:
>
> * Extended validation (EV) code signing certificates are required for **all** submissions.  
> * All certificates must be SHA2 and signed with the **/fd sha256** signtool command line switch
> * (for more information, see this [HLK Blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Hardware-Certification/bg-p/WindowsHardwareCertification)).
