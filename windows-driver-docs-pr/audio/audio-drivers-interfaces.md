In Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems, digital signal processing is referred to as System Effects Audio Processing. This processing is performed by user-mode in-process COM components known as System Effects Audio Processing Objects (sAPOs).

The following topics provide information about the interfaces and the methods that are exposed by the sAPOs.
