Use this method in the Microsoft Store analytics API to download the CAB file that is associated with a particular Windows 7/Windows 8.x driver error. Before you can use this method, you must first use the [get details for a Windows 7 or Windows 8.x driver error](get-details-for-a-windows-7-or-windows-8.x-driver-error.md) method to retrieve the ID of the CAB file you want to download.

You can get other info about Windows 7/Windows 8.x driver errors by using the [get error reporting data for Windows 7 and Windows 8.x drivers](get-error-reporting-data-for-windows-7-and-windows-8.x-drivers.md) and [get details for a Windows 7 or Windows 8.x driver error](get-details-for-a-windows-7-or-windows-8.x-driver-error.md) methods in the Microsoft Store analytics API.
