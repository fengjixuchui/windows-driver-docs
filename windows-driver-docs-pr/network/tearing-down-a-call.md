# Tearing Down a Call





A connection-oriented client can initiate the teardown of an outgoing call that it has made or an incoming call that it has accepted. Similarly, a remote party can initiate the teardown of an outgoing call that it has made or an incoming call that it has accepted.

This section includes:

[Client-Initiated Request to Close a Call](client-initiated-request-to-close-a-call.md)

[Incoming Request to Close a Call](incoming-request-to-close-a-call.md)
