# GDL Comments


A *comment* can appear anywhere that [non-literal whitespace](gdl-whitespace-characters.md) can appear. A comment begins with an asterisk and percent sign (\*%) and ends when a linebreak sequence or continuation linebreak is encountered.

The entire comment is treated as non-literal whitespace. The terminating linebreak sequence is not part of the comment. Comments can appear within a nested context, but no contexts are recognized within a comment.
