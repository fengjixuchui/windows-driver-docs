# Managing Hyper-V Extensible Switch Run-Time Data


This section describes save and restore operations for Hyper-V extensible switch extensions. These operations allow an extension to save and restore run-time data for individual extensible switch network adapters(NICs). These operations are performed when a Hyper-V child partition that has a network adapter connection to an extensible switch port is being stopped or started.

This section includes the following topics:
