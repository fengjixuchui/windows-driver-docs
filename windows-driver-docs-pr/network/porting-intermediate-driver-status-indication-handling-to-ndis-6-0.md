# Porting Intermediate Driver Status Indication Handling to NDIS 6.0





Like NDIS 5.*x* intermediate drivers, NDIS 6.0 intermediate drivers can originate or forward status indications.

For more information about status indications in the miniport upper edge of an intermediate driver, see [Porting Miniport Driver Status Indications to NDIS 6.0](porting-miniport-driver-status-indications-to-ndis-6-0.md).

For more information about status indications in the protocol lower edge of an intermediate driver, see [Porting Protocol Driver Status Indication Handling to NDIS 6.0](porting-protocol-driver-status-indication-handling-to-ndis-6-0.md).
