# Edit | Find


## <span id="ddk_edit_find_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_EDIT_FIND_DBG"></span>


Click **Find** on the **Edit** menu to find text in the active debugging information window.

**Note**  The active window must be the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md) or a [Source window](source-window.md).

 

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+F.

When you click **Find**, the **Find** dialog box appears. In this dialog box, in the **Find what** box, enter the text that you want to find. If there is already text selected, this text automatically appears in the **Find what** box.

In the **Direction** area, click **Up** or **Down** to specify the direction of your search. The search begins wherever the cursor is in the window. You can put the cursor at any location by using the mouse pointer.

Select **Match whole word only** if you want to search for a single whole word. (If you select this option when you search for multiple words, you always receive a failed search.))

Select **Match case** to perform a case-sensitive search.

The **Find** command only changes the WinDbg display. This command does not affect the execution of the target or any other debugger operations.

After you close the **Find** dialog box, you can repeat the search in a forward direction by using the [Edit | Find Next](edit---find-next.md) command or pressing F3. You can repeat the search in a backward direction by pressing SHIFT+F3.
