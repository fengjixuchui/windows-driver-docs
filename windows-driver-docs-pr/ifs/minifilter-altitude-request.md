# Minifilter Altitude Request

A file system minifilter driver developed to the Filter Manager model must have a unique identifier called an altitude that defines its position relative to other minifilters present in the file system stack.

To request a minifilter altitude identifier, send email in an ASCII text e-mail message to [fsfcomm@microsoft.com](mailto:fsfcomm@microsoft.com?subject=Minifilter%20altitude%20request) with the subject: “Minifilter altitude request”. The body of the email must contain the below fields and corresponding information.

An altitude for this filter will then be e-mailed back to the specified contact e-mail address.

You can also send email to [fsfcomm@microsoft.com](mailto:fsfcomm@microsoft.com?subject=Minifilter%20altitude%20request) to update information associated with existing altitudes.

Hi,

Below is the request information to assign an altitude for our Contoso DataKleen file system minifilter.

Company name: Contoso Ltd.
Contact e-mail: filterdevgroup@contoso.com
Product name: Contoso DataKleen
Product URL: http://fsfilters.contoso.com
Product/Filter Description: The Contoso DataKleen filter removes all occurrences of any byte having a value between 128 and 255 during file reads. Our minifilter removes this value since it is not displayable on TTY devices.
Filter filename: ContosoDK.sys
Filter type: FileSystem
Filter start-type: Demand
Requested filter load order group: FSFilter Content Screener
Requested altitude: 268400
Additional information: None

Thanks,

FilterDev
```

## Note

* All fields must be filled out.
* It may take Microsoft up to two weeks to process and assign altitudes. Any missing information may delay the assignment.
* The assigned altitude will eventually be reflected in the altitudes listed in [File System Minifilter Allocated Altitudes](allocated-altitudes.md). Please be aware that Microsoft only updates this list annually.
