# Unicode Representations in XML Snapshots


The GDL parser can represent Unicode by using UTF-8 or UTF-16 in the snapshots and schemas that it generates. Users can select this Unicode through an option flag in the corresponding interface function. UTF-8-encoded snapshots can be loaded into any text editor for ease of viewing and are typically smaller than the UTF-16 version.
