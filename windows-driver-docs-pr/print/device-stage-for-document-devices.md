# Device Stage for Document Devices

The Windows Device Experience is a collection of features to improve how users discover and use devices that are connected to their PC. These user features are supported by system and platform features that define how device makers present their devices and related applications and services in Windows.

Device Stage provides a rich platform for developing and distributing device-specific experiences. With Device Stage, you can create experiences that match the branding, functionality, and services of your device by defining XML files and graphics. Device Stage is supported for a limited number of device classes.

This section describes device-class specific features for document devices in the following topics:

## Document Device Class

The document devices include Printers, Scanners, and Multifunction Printers (MFP). In addition to providing the basics of the device stage platform, Windows 7 also includes a variety of printing and scanning specific features, which can easily be included in a Device Stage experience.
