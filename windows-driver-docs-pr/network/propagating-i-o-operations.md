# Propagating I/O Operations


\[The TCP chimney offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]

This section describes how an intermediate driver propagates an I/O operation that was initiated by the host stack and the completion of such an operation by an underlying offload target.

This section includes:

-   [Propagating an I/O Operation](propagating-an-i-o-operation.md)

-   [Propagating the Completion of an I/O Operation](propagating-the-completion-of-an-i-o-operation.md)
