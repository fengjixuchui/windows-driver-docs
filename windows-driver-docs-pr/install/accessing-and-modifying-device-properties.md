# Accessing and Modifying Device Properties


[Device properties](device-properties.md) codify the attributes of [*device instances*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556277#wdkgloss-device-instance), [device setup classes](device-setup-classes.md), [device interface classes](device-interface-classes.md), and [*device interfaces*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556277#wdkgloss-device-interface).

This section provides guidelines that [driver package](driver-packages.md) components must follow when they access or modify device properties. These guidelines are discussed in the following topics:

[Accessing Device Properties](accessing-device-properties.md)

[Rules for Modifying Device Properties](modifying-device-properties.md)
