<td align="left"><p>Independent unit of access that accepts 1667 commands and optionally provides access to user data (see Logical Unit). According to the 1667 specification, an ACT is not required to provide a user data access function. A 1667 device may implement one or more ACTs.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Authentication</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>(As it relates to IEEE 1667) the act of verifying the veracity of the identity claimed by either the host or the device. In the password authentication case, a secret password established by the user of the device is the credential that serves this purpose. In the certificate authentication case, possession of the private key must be proven by successfully decrypting a random stream of bytes encrypted with the paired public key.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Authorization</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Indication that concomitant access to the governed resource is authorized after a device or host identity has been authenticated. Host-to-device authentication governs authorized access to the user data portion of the associated ACT, whereas successful device-to-host authentication authorizes the connected data channel between the device and the host.</p></td>

Not to be confused with the Removable field of the DEVICE_CAPABILITIES used to indicate whether a PDO represents a hot-pluggable device, RMB refers to a property of the media rather than the device itself. Media for which RMB=1 is treated differently by the system than show media with RMB=0.</p></td>
