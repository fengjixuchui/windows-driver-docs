If you’re developing device experiences for Windows 8.1, use the Device Metadata Authoring Wizard available with [Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42273).  \]

After you launch the **Authoring** tool, the **Welcome to the Metadata Authoring Wizard** screen appears. Select one of the following options:

-   To create a new device metadata package, select **Create new device metadata package**, and then click **Next**.
-   To update an existing device metadata package, select **Update existing device metadata package**, click **Browse** to select the package, and then click **Next**.
    **Note**  You can't edit Device Stage experiences with the tool. However, the Device Stage folder isn't changed if you update the package by using this tool.
