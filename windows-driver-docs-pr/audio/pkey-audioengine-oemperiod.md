# PKEY\_AudioEngine\_OEMPeriod


The Windows audio engine runs at predetermined intervals that are referred to as the *periodicity* of the audio engine. In Windows 7 and later versions of Windows, the audio engine runs with a periodicity of 10ms by default. In Windows 7, you can use an INF file and a new registry key, **PKEY\_AudioEngine\_OEMPeriod**, to customize the periodicity for your audio device driver. This is a per endpoint setting.

The following excerpt from an INF file shows how to use the [**INF AddReg directive**](../install/inf-addreg-directive.md) to customize the periodicity for an audio device driver.

[Strings]
PKEY_AudioEndpoint_Association = "{1DA5D803-D492-4EDD-8C23-E0C0FFEE7F0E},2"
PKEY_AudioEngine_OEMPeriod = "{E4870E26-3CC5-4CD2-BA46-CA0A9A70ED04},6"
REG_BINARY          = "0x00000001"
```

Periodicity is specified as VT\_BLOB. And the valid periodicity range is 50000-90000 (5-9ms) on even 10000 HNSTIME unit boundaries (for example, 50000, 60000, 70000, 80000 or 90000).

In the preceding excerpt from an INF file, the following REG\_BINARY data is provided for customization:

The periodicity of 8ms is represented in HNSTIME units as 80000. In hexadecimal notation this value is represented as 0x013880. When this hexadecimal value is written four bits (nibbles) at a time, with least significant bits first, the result is 80,38,01. This is the value that is provided as a REG\_BINARY data type.

Periodicity is specified as a VT\_BLOB data type. This is represented by a decimal value of 65. In hexadecimal format 65 is represented by the value 41 and the preceding INF file excerpt shows the REG\_BINARY data sequence with its first value of 41.
