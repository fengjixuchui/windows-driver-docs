# File System Filter Drivers


<div class="alert">
<strong>Note</strong>   For optimal reliability and performance, we recommend using <a href="filter-manager-and-minifilter-driver-architecture.md" data-raw-source="[file system minifilter drivers](filter-manager-and-minifilter-driver-architecture.md)">file system minifilter drivers</a> instead of legacy file system filter drivers. Also, legacy file system filter drivers canâ€™t attach to direct access (DAX) volumes. For more about file system minifilter drivers, see <a href="advantages-of-the-filter-manager-model.md" data-raw-source="[Advantages of the Filter Manager Model](advantages-of-the-filter-manager-model.md)">Advantages of the Filter Manager Model</a>. To port your legacy driver to a minifilter driver, see <a href="guidelines-for-porting-legacy-filter-drivers.md" data-raw-source="[Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers](guidelines-for-porting-legacy-filter-drivers.md)">Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers</a>.
