# Porting Status Indication Operations to CoNDIS 6.0





The CoNDIS 6.0 status indication functions are similar to the NDIS 5. *x* status indication functions. The primary difference between the CoNDIS 6.0 interfaces and the NDIS 5. *x* interface is that the NDIS 6.0 functions incorporate the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure.
