# Changing the QoS of an Active VC





A connection-oriented client can request a change in the quality of service (QoS) on an active virtual connection (VC) for an outgoing or an incoming call. A remote client can also make such a request. In this case, a call manager or MCM driver indicates the remote client's incoming request to change the QoS.

This section includes:

[Client-Initiated Request to Change Call Parameters](client-initiated-request-to-change-call-parameters.md)

[Incoming Request to Change Call Parameters](incoming-request-to-change-call-parameters.md)
