# NDIS Filter Intermediate Drivers





**Note**  Filter intermediate drivers are not supported in NDIS 6.0 and later. You should use the NDIS filter driver interface instead. For more information about NDIS filter drivers, see [NDIS Filter Drivers](ndis-filter-drivers.md).

 

In NDIS 5.*x*, an *NDIS filter intermediate driver* exposes one virtual miniport for each underlying miniport driver that is bound to the intermediate driver's lower (protocol) edge.
