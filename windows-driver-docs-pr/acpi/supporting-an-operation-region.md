An operation region is the communication interface between an ACPI device and the device's function driver. The following topics describe how a function driver supports an operating region:

[Maintaining an Operation Region Memory Buffer](maintaining-an-operation-region-memory-buffer.md)

[Registering and Deregistering an Operation Region Handler](registering-and-deregistering-an-operation-region-handler.md)

[Implementing an Operation Region Handler](implementing-an-operation-region-handler.md)
