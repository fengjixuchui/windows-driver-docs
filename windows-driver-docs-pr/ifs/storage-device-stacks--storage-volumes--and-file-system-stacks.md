Before exploring how file system filter drivers attach to file systems and volumes, it is necessary to understand the relationship between storage device stacks, storage volumes, and file system stacks. This relationship is discussed in the following sections:

[Storage Device Stacks](storage-device-stacks.md)

[Storage Volumes](storage-volumes.md)

[File System Stacks](file-system-stacks.md)
