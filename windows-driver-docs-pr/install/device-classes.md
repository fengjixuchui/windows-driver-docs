# Device Classes





This section provides information about two device classes used to put devices and drivers into groups whose members have similar characteristics:

<a href="" id="device-setup-classes"></a>[Device Setup Classes](device-setup-classes.md)  
Used to group devices together that are installed and configured in a similar manner.

<a href="" id="device-interface-classes"></a>[Device Interface Classes](device-interface-classes.md)  
Used to group devices together that provide similar capabilities.

Because of similarities in the way both types of device classes are specified and used, the section provides a topic entitled [Setup Classes vs. Interface Classes](setup-classes-versus-interface-classes.md).

[SetupAPI](setupapi.md) functions use [device information sets](device-information-sets.md) to expose the members of a class to user-mode code.
