## <span id="ddk_edit_find_next_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_EDIT_FIND_NEXT_DBG"></span>


Click **Find Next** on the **Edit** menu to repeat the previous search and find the next match.

This command is equivalent to pressing F3.

To repeat the search in a backward direction, press SHIFT+F3.

If you have not previously performed any searches, use the **Edit | Find Next** command, press F3, or press SHIFT+F3 to open the **Find** dialog box (similar to the [Edit | Find](edit---find.md) command).
