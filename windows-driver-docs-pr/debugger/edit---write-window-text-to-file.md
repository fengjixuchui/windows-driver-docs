Click **Write Window Text to File** on the **Edit** menu to save all of the text in the active debugging information window to a file.

This command is available only if the active window is the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md), [Calls window](calls-window.md), or Scratch Pad.

When you click **Write Windows Text to File**, the **Write Window Text to File** dialog box appears. In this dialog box, enter the name of the file where you want to save the window text.

Click **Save** to save the file or click **Cancel** to exit.
