# Querying the PCI Configuration Data of a Virtual Function


This section describes the methods by which an overlying driver can obtain information from the PCI configuration space for a PCI Express (PCIe) Virtual Function (VF). The VF is exposed by a network adapter that supports single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).

**Note**  These methods can only be used by overlying drivers that run in the management operating system of the Hyper-V parent partition.

 

This section includes the following topics:

[Querying the PCI Vendor and Device Identifiers for a Virtual Function](querying-the-pci-vendor-and-device-identifiers-for-a-virtual-function.md)
