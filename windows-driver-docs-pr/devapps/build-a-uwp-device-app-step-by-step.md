This step-by-step guide describes in detail how to build a UWP device app with Microsoft Visual Studio and the Device Metadata Authoring Wizard. For a high-level introduction to this process, see [Building UWP device apps](the-workflow.md).

A UWP device app is a special kind of UWP app that device manufacturers create to serve as a companion to their internal or peripheral device. By using device metadata, device apps can run privileged operations and automatically install when a device is plugged in. For more info about UWP device apps, see [Meet UWP device apps](meet-uwp-device-apps.md).
