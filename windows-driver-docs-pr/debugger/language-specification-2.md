# Language Specification 2


This package ships with a srcsrv.dll that can operate without SRCSRVCMD being defined in the srcsrv data stream of a .pdb file. While such capability is of no use for normal file extraction from source control systems, it is useful for direct access of files from a UNC share or HTTP site. See [HTTP Sites and UNC Shares](http-sites-and-unc-shares.md) for more details.
