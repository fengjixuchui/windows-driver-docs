# Saving Hyper-V Extensible Switch Run-Time Data


This section describes the operation by which a Hyper-V Extensible Switch extension can save run-time data for individual network adapters (NICs). This operation is performed when a Hyper-V child partition with a network adapter connection to an extensible switch port is being stopped or its state is being saved.

This section includes the following topics:
