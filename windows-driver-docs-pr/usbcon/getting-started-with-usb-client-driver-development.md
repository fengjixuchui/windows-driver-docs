# First steps for USB client driver development

This section introduces you to USB driver development. The section applies to you if you are new to driver development; want to implement a driver for a USB device, for which Microsoft does not provide an in-box driver. Such a driver is termed as a *USB client driver* in this documentation set. The topics in this section describe high-level USB concepts and provide step-by-step instructions about performing common tasks of a USB client driver. For detailed information about those concepts see USB specifications at [USB Documents](https://usb.org/documents).

As a driver developer, you must have coding experience in the C programming language, and understand the concepts of function pointers, callback functions, and event handlers. If you are going to write a driver based on the User-Mode Driver Framework, make sure that you familiarize yourself with C++ and COM.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Step 1</strong>—Read the [USB Specification 3.2](https://usb.org/document-library/usb-32-specification-released-september-22-2017-and-ecns).</p></td>
<td>Learn about the industry specification and different components (device, host controller, and hub) of the architecture. It's important to understand the data flow model, how the host and device communicate with each other, and the format of the requests that the device expects.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Step 2</strong>—Obtain a test USB device.</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Have a USB device and its hardware specification. The specification describes device capabilities and the supported vendor commands. Use the specification to determine the functionality of the device driver and the related design decisions.</li>
<li>Have the [OSR USB FX2 learning kit](https://www.amazon.com/OSR-USB-FX2-Learning-Kit/dp/B07FNSYCLR) if you are new to USB driver development. The kit is the most suitable to study USB samples included in this documentation set.</li>
<li>Have a Microsoft USB Test Tool (MUTT) devices. MUTT hardware can be purchased from [JJG Technologies](http://www.jjgtechnologies.com/Mutt20.htm). The device does not have installed firmware installed. To install firmware, download the [MUTT software package](/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/microsoft-usb-test-tool--mutt--devices). For more information, see the documentation included with the package.</li>

<td><p><strong>Step 3</strong>—Study your <a href="usb-device-layout.md" data-raw-source="[USB device layout](usb-device-layout.md)">USB device layout</a> and the related <a href="usb-descriptors.md" data-raw-source="[USB descriptors](usb-descriptors.md)">USB descriptors</a>.</p></td>
<td>Describe your device capabilities by reading the configuration descriptor, interface descriptors for each supported alternate settings, and their endpoint descriptors. By using [USBView](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview), you can browse all USB controllers and the USB devices connected to them, and also inspect the device configuration.</td>
