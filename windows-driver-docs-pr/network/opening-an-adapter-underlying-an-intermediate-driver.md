# Opening an Adapter Underlying an Intermediate Driver





Opening an adapter underlying an intermediate driver is the same as opening an underlying adapter in a protocol driver. For more information about opening an underlying adapter in an intermediate driver, see [Binding to an Adapter](binding-to-an-adapter.md).
