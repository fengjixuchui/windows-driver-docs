# Compressing Raster Data





Unidrv supports raster data compression using the following three formats:

-   Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), version 4.0

-   Delta-Row Compression (DRC)

-   East Asian Run-Length Encoding (FE-RLE)

These methods are defined in the *HP PCL 5 Printer Language Technical Reference*. (This resource may not be available in some languages and countries.)

You can include entries in a GPD file to indicate which of these compression formats your printer supports. You can also provide your own compression algorithm.

For more information about raster data compression, see the following topics:
