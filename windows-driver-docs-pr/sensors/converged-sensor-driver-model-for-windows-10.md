# Universal sensor driver model for Windows 10


The topics in this section provide information about the universal sensor driver model for Windows 10.

Conceptual and programming topics:

-   [Overview of universal sensor driver model](overview-of-converged-sensor-driver-model.md)
-   [How to build a universal sensor driver](how-to-build-a-universal-sensor-driver.md)

The Sensors sample driver:

-   [Sensors sample driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/sensors). (To evaluate the sensors sample driver before learning how to develop one.)
-   [Write and deploy your universal sensor driver](write-and-deploy-your-universal-sensor-driver.md). (To navigate directly to information about how to develop and build a sensor driver.)
