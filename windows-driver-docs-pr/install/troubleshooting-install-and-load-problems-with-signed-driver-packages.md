# Troubleshooting Install and Load Problems with Signed Driver Packages


There are specific steps that you can take to identify and troubleshoot potential problems related to verifying kernel-mode code signatures. This section provides information about how to troubleshoot problems with the [kernel-mode code signing policy](kernel-mode-code-signing-policy--windows-vista-and-later-.md) and the [Plug and Play (PnP) device installation signing requirements](pnp-device-installation-signing-requirements--windows-vista-and-later-.md) of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.

The main tools for troubleshooting install and load problems with test-signed drivers are the following:

[Detecting Driver Load Errors](detecting-driver-load-errors.md)

[Code Integrity Diagnostic System Log Events](code-integrity-diagnostic-system-log-events.md)

[SetupAPI Device Installation Log Entries](setupapi-device-installation-log-entries.md)
