# RemoveiSNSServer


The **RemoveiSNSServer** method removes an iSNS server from the list of iSNS servers that the initiator queries for targets. HBA initiators should store the list of iSNS servers in nonvolatile memory.

**RemoveiSNSServer** belongs to the unpublished [MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class](msiscsi-operations-wmi-class.md). For a description of the parameters of the **RemoveiSNSServer** method, see the member descriptions for the [**RemoveiSNSServer\_IN**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563981) and [**RemoveiSNSServer\_OUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563982) structures.

Miniport drivers that implement the MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class are not required to support this method.
