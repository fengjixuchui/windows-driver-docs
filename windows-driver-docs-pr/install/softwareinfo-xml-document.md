For Windows 8 or later, a metadata package may contain one Softwareinfo.xml file, which contains information for downloading an app that is associated with the device and giving privileged access to applications.

The data within the Softwareinfo.xml file is formatted based on the [**SoftwareInfo XML schema**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/metadata/jj159075(v=vs.85)).
