# Performing Floating-point Operations in DirectDraw


## <span id="ddk_performing_floating_point_operations_in_directdraw_gg"></span><span id="DDK_PERFORMING_FLOATING_POINT_OPERATIONS_IN_DIRECTDRAW_GG"></span>


DirectDraw driver callback functions must perform all floating-point operations between calls to the GDI-supplied [**EngSaveFloatingPointState**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-engsavefloatingpointstate) and [**EngRestoreFloatingPointState**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-engrestorefloatingpointstate) functions. That is, the driver's callback functions must save the floating-point state prior to performing a floating-point operation and must restore the floating-point state when the floating-point operation completes. For more information about floating-point operations, see [Floating-Point Operations in Graphics Driver Functions](floating-point-operations-in-graphics-driver-functions.md).
