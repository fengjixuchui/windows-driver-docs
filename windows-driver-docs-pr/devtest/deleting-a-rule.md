# Deleting a Rule


To delete a rule from a filter:

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell in the session, and then click **Manage Filters**.

2.  In the **Manage Filters** dialog box, in the **Current Rules** area, select the rule that you want to delete.

3.  Click **Delete Rule**.

If you have saved the rule in a [workspace](using-traceview-workspaces.md), you must [resave the workspace](saving-or-resaving-a-workspace.md) after deleting the rule. Otherwise, the rule is not deleted from the workspace.
