# Overview of Installing Private Builds of Inbox Drivers


Starting with Windows Vista, when a Plug and Play (PnP) device is installed on a computer system, Windows selects a driver based on several factors, such as the [hardware ID](hardware-ids.md) or [compatible ID](compatible-ids.md), date, and version. Windows analyzes these factors to assign a rank that indicates how well the driver matches the device. The lower the rank, the better a match the driver is for the device.

Also, starting with Windows Vista, if a driver has a signature from a Windows signing authority (Microsoft signature), Windows ranks it better than another driver for the same device that was signed with:

-   A third-party release signature. This type of signature is generated by using a [Software Publisher Certificate](software-publisher-certificate.md) that is obtained from a third-party certification authority (CA) authorized by Microsoft to issue such certificates.

-   A Microsoft signature for a Windows version that is earlier than the [LowerLogoVersion](lowerlogoversion.md) value of the driver's [device setup class](./overview-of-device-setup-classes.md).

The Microsoft signature types include the following:

-   Premium WHQL signatures and standard WHQL signatures

-   Signatures for inbox drivers

-   Windows Sustained Engineering (Windows SE) signatures

-   A WHQL signature for a Windows version that is the same or later than the Windows version that is specified by the [LowerLogoVersion](lowerlogoversion.md) value that is set for the device setup class of a driver

**Note**  Even if a driver that has a third-party signature is a better match for the device, Windows selects the driver that has a Microsoft signature. Using a publisher identity certificate \[PIC\] for the third-party signature does not change this behavior.

 

Starting with Windows Vista, the [**AllSignersEqual** Group Policy](./allsigningequal-group-policy.md) controls how Windows ranks Microsoft-signed drivers and third party-signed drivers. When **AllSignersEqual** is enabled, Windows treats all Microsoft signatures and third-party signatures as equal with respect to rank when selecting the driver that is the best match for a device.

**Note**  In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the **AllSignersEqual** Group Policy is disabled by default. Starting with Windows 7, this Group Policy is enabled by default.

 

To install a private build of an inbox driver, you must do the following:

-   Build a private version of the inbox driver. You must ensure that the private build outranks the Microsoft-signed version when signatures are treated equally. The private build must also be digitally signed by using tools that are provided with the WDK.

    For more information, see [Creating a Private Build of an Inbox Driver](creating-a-private-build-of-an-in-box-driver.md).

-   Enable the [AllSignersEqual Group Policy](./allsigningequal-group-policy.md) on the target system so that the operating system views all Microsoft signature types and third-party signatures as equal in rank when it selects the driver that is the best match for a device.
