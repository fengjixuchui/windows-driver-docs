# Power Management for WDM Lower Edge





NDIS handles all Plug and Play (PnP) and power management IRPs for NDIS-WDM miniport drivers. Therefore, NDIS-WDM miniport drivers should respond to PnP and power management OIDs, based on device capabilities, as described in [Power Management for NDIS Miniport Drivers](required-and-optional-oids-for-power-management.md).
