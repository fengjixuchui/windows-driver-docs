# Specifying a NetDMA Provider Friendly Name


**Note**  The NetDMA interface is not supported in Windows 8 and later.

 




For improved manageability and testing, NetDMA 2.0 providers and later must provide a friendly name for the provider in the **FriendlyName** member of the [**NET\_DMA\_PROVIDER\_CHARACTERISTICS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568738) structure.
