# How Device Property Pages are Displayed


A device property page is displayed in the following ways:

-   Device Manager displays the property page any time that the properties for a device are displayed.

-   Starting with Windows 7, **Devices and Printers** displays the property page any time that a user right-clicks a device. To display the property page in **Devices and Printers**, do the following:

    -   Right-click the icon in **Devices and Printers** that represents a device that is connected to the system.

    -   Click **Properties**.

    -   On the **Properties** window, click the **Hardware** tab, and then click **Properties**.
