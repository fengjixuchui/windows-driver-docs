# File | Image File Path


## <span id="ddk_file_image_file_path_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_FILE_IMAGE_FILE_PATH_DBG"></span>


Select **Image File Path** on the **File** menu to display, set, or append to the executable image path.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+I.

### <span id="executable_image_search_path_dialog_box"></span><span id="EXECUTABLE_IMAGE_SEARCH_PATH_DIALOG_BOX"></span>Executable Image Search Path Dialog Box

When you select **Image File Path**, the **Executable Image Search Path** dialog box appears. This dialog box displays the current executable image path. If the **Image path** box is blank, there is no current executable image path.

You can enter a new path or edit the old path. If you want to search more than one directory, separate the directory names with semicolons.

Select **OK** to save changes, or select **Cancel** to discard changes.

If you select the **Reload** check box, the debugger will reload all loaded image and symbol files after you select **OK**. This command is equivalent to using the [**.reload (Reload Module)**](-reload--reload-module-.md) command.

You can also select **Browse** to open the **Browse For Folder** dialog box.

### <span id="browse_for_folder_dialog_box"></span><span id="BROWSE_FOR_FOLDER_DIALOG_BOX"></span>Browse For Folder Dialog Box

In the **Browse For Folder** dialog box, you can browse through the folders on your computer or your network. You can also use the **Make New Folder** button to create a new folder. If you select and hold (or right-click) a file or folder in this dialog box, a standard Windows shortcut menu appears.

Select **OK** to append the selected folder to the executable image path and return to the **Executable Image Search Path** dialog box.
