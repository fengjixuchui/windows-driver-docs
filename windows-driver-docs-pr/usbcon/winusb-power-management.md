# WinUSB Power Management


WinUSB uses the KMDF state machines for power management. Power policies are managed through calls to [**WinUsb\_SetPowerPolicy**](/windows/win32/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_setpowerpolicy).

In order to modify the power behavior of WinUSB, default registry settings can be modified in the device's INF. These values must be written to the device specific location in the registry by adding the values in the **HW.AddReg** section of the INF.

The registry values described in the following list can be specified in the device's INF to modify the power behavior.

<a href="" id="system-wake"></a>**System Wake**  
This feature is controlled by the **SystemWakeEnabled** DWORD registry setting. This value indicates whether the device should be allowed to wake the system from a low power state.

```INF
HKR,,SystemWakeEnabled,0x00010001,1
```

-   A value of zero, or the absence of this value indicates that the device is not allowed to wake the system.
-   To allow a device to wake the system, set **SystemWakeEnabled** to a nonzero value. A check box in the device **Properties** page is automatically enabled so that the user can override the setting.

**Note**  Changing the **SystemWakeEnabled** setting has no affect on selective suspend, this registry value only pertains to system suspend.

 

<a href="" id="selective-suspend"></a>**Selective Suspend**  
Selective suspend can be disabled by any of several system or WinUSB settings. A single setting cannot force WinUSB to enable selective suspend.

The following power policy settings that are specified in [**WinUsb\_SetPowerPolicy**](/windows/win32/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_setpowerpolicy)'s *PolicyType* parameter affect the behavior of selective suspend:

-   AUTO\_SUSPEND When set to zero, it does not set the device to selective suspend mode.
-   SUSPEND\_DELAY Sets the time between when the device becomes idle and when WinUSB requests the device to go into selective suspend.

The following table shows how the registry keys affect the selective suspend feature.

All writes and control transfers force the device into the **D0** power state and reset the idle timer. The IN endpoint queues are not power managed. Read requests wake the device when they are submitted. However, a device can become idle while a read request waits.
