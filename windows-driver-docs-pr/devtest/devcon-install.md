# DevCon Install


Creates a new, root-enumerated devnode for a non-Plug and Play device and installs its supporting software. Valid only on the local computer.

```
    devcon [/r] install INFfile HardwareID 
```

## <span id="ddk_devcon_install_tools"></span><span id="DDK_DEVCON_INSTALL_TOOLS"></span>Parameters


<span id="________r______"></span><span id="________R______"></span> **/r**   
Conditional reboot. Reboots the system after completing an operation when a reboot is required to make the change effective. By default, DevCon does not reboot the system.

<span id="_______INFfile______"></span><span id="_______inffile______"></span><span id="_______INFFILE______"></span> *INFfile*   
Specifies the full path and file name of the INF file for the device. If you omit the path, DevCon assumes that the file is in the current directory.

<span id="_______HardwareID______"></span><span id="_______hardwareid______"></span><span id="_______HARDWAREID______"></span> *HardwareID*   
Specifies a hardware ID for the device.

The specified hardware ID must exactly match the hardware ID of the device. Patterns are not valid. Do not type a single quote character (**'**) to indicate a literal value. For more information, see [Hardware IDs](../install/hardware-ids.md) and [Device Identification Strings](../install/device-identification-strings.md).

### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

The system might need to be rebooted to make this change effective. To have DevCon reboot the system, add the conditional reboot parameter (**/r**) to the command.

You cannot use the **DevCon Install** operation for Plug and Play devices.

The **DevCon Install** operation creates a new non-Plug and Play device node. Then, it uses the [**DevCon Update**](devcon-update.md) operation to install drivers for the newly added device. As a result, the success message for the **DevCon Install** operation reports that DevCon has created the device node and that it has updated the drivers for the device.

If any step of the **DevCon Install** operation fails, DevCon displays a failure message and does not proceed with the driver installation.

The **DevCon Install** command creates a new non-Plug and Play device node each time you run it. To update or reinstall drivers, use the [**DevCon Update**](devcon-update.md) command.
