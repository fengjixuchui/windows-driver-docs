# Speaker Phantoming


Usually, all the loudspeakers in a multichannel system, including the center and satellite loudspeakers, are always present. However, users might not have all the expected loudspeakers or they might choose to turn one or more of them off. A common example is a multichannel system that lacks a center loudspeaker. Speaker phantoming reproduces the sound from the missing loudspeaker, typically by splitting it between the adjacent loudspeakers. However, phantoming can also use other combinations such as the rear-left and rear-right or side-left and side-right speakers.
