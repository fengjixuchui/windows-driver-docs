# Creating a Catalog File for a Test-Signed Driver Package


To create a [catalog file](catalog-files.md) for a test-signed PnP [driver package](driver-packages.md), follow the same procedure that is used to [create a catalog file for a PnP driver package](creating-a-catalog-file-for-a-pnp-driver-package.md).

To create a catalog file for a test-signed non-PnP driver package, follow the same procedure that is used to [create a catalog file for a non-PnP driver package](creating-a-catalog-file-for-a-non-pnp-driver-package.md).
