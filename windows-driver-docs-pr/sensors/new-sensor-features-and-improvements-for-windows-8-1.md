# New sensor features and improvements for Windows 8.1


This topic summarizes the new features and improvements for Sensors in WindowsWindows 8.1.

## Support for HID Devices


Windows 8.1 includes in-box support for any sensor that runs on the HID transport. This support is provided by a HID class driver.

The class driver supports the eleven sensors in the following list:

-   Accelerometer 3D
-   Ambient Light
-   Ambient Temperature
-   Atmospheric Pressure
-   Compass 3D
-   Device Orientation
-   Gyroscope 3D
-   Humidity
-   Inclinometer 3D
-   Presence
-   Proximity

In addition to these eleven sensors, the HID class driver supports a Custom class that a device vendor can use to support any sensor not found in the list.

## Testing sensor functionality with the Sensor Diagnostic Tool


You can use the Sensor Diagnostic Tool to test your sensor driver, firmware, and hardware. This tool is described in [The Sensor Diagnostic Tool](the-sensor-diagnostic-tool.md) topic.

## Sensor driver logic


The new programming guide includes a section that describes driver logic for a sensor device driver. This logic is presented as pseudo code that covers: driver initialization, driver interface, driver updates, device updates, and internal driver methods. You'll find this new section beginning with the [Sensor driver logic](driver-logic--pseudo-code-.md) topic.

## Sensors Geolocation Driver Sample


The geolocation sample driver demonstrates a minimal UMDF driver that emulates a Global Positioning System (GPS) device. This sample driver is described in detail in the new [Programming Guide](programming-guide.md).

The geolocation sample driver also includes code that demonstrates adding support for the Radio Management API. This is described in the [Supporting radio managment](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/gnss/supporting-radio-management) topic.
