# Wi-Fi support in firmware 


Wi-Fi support has been initially defined in UEFI Specification 2.5, with clarification in UEFI Spec 2.6.

The Windows operating system and the Windows Pre-installation Environment (WinPE) do not currently have support to fully leverage these features of UEFI. 

Send email to <SAUEFI@Microsoft.com> if you have questions or concerns, or if your company has an interest in this feature.
