# Providing IPrintCoreHelper Configuration Service to Filters


The **IPrintCoreHelper** interface is a new interface that is implemented by the Windows Vista Unidrv/PScript5 configuration module. This interface allows the client machine to:

1.  Enumerate GPD or PPD features, options, and constraints.

2.  Get values for PPD's global, feature, or option attributes.

3.  Get current settings for doc-sticky and printer-sticky GPD or PPD features.

4.  Create a GDL parser snapshot for full access to GPD and GDL content.
