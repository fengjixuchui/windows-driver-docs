# Design messages in a mobile broadband app


Your mobile broadband app is a convenient way to communicate with your customers about important account information. The app should have a section or link on the home screen where end users can view important account messages. While important operator messages should be shown as tile and toast notifications, they should also be shown in app view because of the transient nature of toast notifications and the limited amount of text that can be shown in a tile notification.

You should not show user-to-user chat text messaging, promotions, and advertisements in the messages section mixed together with operator notifications and alerts because customers might miss important operator notifications. You can display promotions and advertisements in the layout of your app and display user-to-user chat text messages in a separate section of the user interface.

The following table shows some example operator messages and alerts.
