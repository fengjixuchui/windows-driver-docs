# Configuring a Computer to Support Release-Signing


Before a release-signed driver package can be installed on a computer, follow these steps to configure the computer to support release signing:

-   Disable the TESTSIGNING Boot Configuration Option. For more information about this option, see [the TESTSIGNING Boot Configuration Option](the-testsigning-boot-configuration-option.md).

-   Enable Code Integrity event logging and system auditing to help troubleshoot problems during release-signed driver installation and loading. For more information, see [Enabling Code Integrity Event Logging and System Auditing](enabling-code-integrity-event-logging-and-system-auditing.md).

After the computer is reconfigured to enable release-signing, restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
