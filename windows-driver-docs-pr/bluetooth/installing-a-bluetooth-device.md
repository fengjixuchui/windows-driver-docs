# Installing a Bluetooth Device

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer experiencing Bluetooth device installation issues see [Pair a Bluetooth device in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device)

There are two installation types for Bluetooth profile drivers:

- **Client-side installation** for remote devices where the remote device advertises its services and the computer connects to it. Examples include: mouse devices, keyboards, and printers.

- **Server-side installation** where the computer advertises services and remote devices can connect to the computer to use those services. For example, a vendor could author a server-side installation to enable a PDA to print to a printer attached to the computer.

These two installation types require different installation procedures.

## Installing a Client-side Profile Driver

A user that wants to use a Bluetooth-enabled device will bring the device within range of the computer and initiate a connection from the computer to the remote device using the following installation sequence for a client-side profile driver.

1. Launch Bluetooth Devices in **Control Panel** to find all devices within range of the computer.

2. Select the device to pair with.

3. Pair (or bond) the device with the local radio. This may or may not involve a PIN exchange.

4. The local radio issues an SDP inquiry to identify the services supported on the remote device.

5. The **Found New Hardware Wizard** searches for appropriate drivers on the local hard disk drive, and/or on Windows Update.

6. If the **Found New Hardware Wizard** does not find an appropriate driver for the device, it prompts the user to insert the profile driver installation media that contains the profile driver's device setup information file (INF file).

## Installing a Server-side Profile Driver

The Bluetooth driver stack supports service GUIDs as defined by the Bluetooth SIG, as well as custom GUIDs (that is, GUIDs that are not defined by the Bluetooth SIG).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Guidgen.exe** tool provided with the Microsoft Windows SDK can be used to create custom GUIDs.

A user-mode installation application must be written to expose computer functionality that remote Bluetooth devices can use.

The installation application must communicate with the Bluetooth driver stack to create a service GUID for the functionality to expose. Vendors specify the service GUID in the application and in their device installation INF file.

The installation application must call the user-mode API [BluetoothSetLocalServiceInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/bluetoothapis/nf-bluetoothapis-bluetoothsetlocalserviceinfo). Before the application can call this API the application must have the SE\_LOAD\_DRIVER\_NAME security privilege. The following code example demonstrates how to obtain this privilege. **Note** that the example does not demonstrate error handling.

```cpp
HANDLE procToken;
LUID luid;
TOKEN_PRIVILEGES tp;

OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES | TOKEN_QUERY, &procToken);

LookupPrivilegeValue(NULL, SE_LOAD_DRIVER_NAME, &luid);

Tp.PrivilegeCount = 1;
Tp.privileges[0].Luid = luid;
Tp.Privileges[0].Attributes = SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED;

AdjustTokenPrivileges(procToken, FALSE, &tp, sizeof(TOKEN_PRIVILEGES), (PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES) NULL, (PDWORD)NULL)
```

## Profile Driver INF file

A profile driver's INF file contains information about a Bluetooth device for client-side installation. For a server-side installation, the INF file specifies a device ID that corresponds to the service GUID created by the installation application. All Bluetooth devices are members of the **Bluetooth** class. The Bluetooth class installer (*Bthci.dll*) assists in installing profile drivers.

For more information about creating and distributing INF files and installing drivers, see [Creating an INF File](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/overview-of-inf-files) and [INF File Sections and Directives](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-file-sections-and-directives).

### Plug and Play IDs

The Bluetooth driver stack generates hardware IDs according to the following templates:

- BTHENUM\\{ *ServiceGUID*}\_VID& *nnnnnnnn*

- BTHENUM\\{ *ServiceGUID*}\_VID& *nnnnnnnn*\_PID& *nnnn*

- BTHENUM\\{ *ServiceGUID*}\_LOCALMFG& *nnnn*

The Bluetooth driver stack generates compatible IDs according to the following template:

- BTHENUM\\{ *ServiceGUID*}

*ServiceGUID* is a 16-bit GUID expanded into a 128-bit GUID, as defined by the Bluetooth specification. For example, {00001124-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB} corresponds to an HID device.

- The 8 digits following *VID&* correspond to the vendor ID code.

- The 4 digits following *PID&* correspond to the product ID code.

- The 4 digits following *LOCALMFG&* correspond to the manufacturer of the local Bluetooth radio.

- The VID/PID and LOCALMFG tags are independent of each other.

The most generic device ID is a *ServiceGUID* by itself. For example:

BTHENUM\\{00001124-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}

The Bluetooth driver stack can be restricted to load your profile driver and software to run only on a specific release of a remote device by using Plug and Play IDs in both the remote device and the INF file. **Note** that the Bluetooth driver stack generates a VID/PID pair only if the device publishes a Plug and Play ID that the stack can detect using SDP. For example:

BTHENUM\\{00001124-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}\_VID& *nnnnnnnn*\_PID& *nnnn*

The Bluetooth driver stack can be restricted to load profile driver and software to run only on a specific local Bluetooth radio by specifying the LOCALMFG tag in the device ID in your INF file. For example:

BTHENUM\\{00001124-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}\_LOCALMFG& *nnnn*
