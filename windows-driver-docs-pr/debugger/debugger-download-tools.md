# Download Debugging Tools for Windows

The Windows Debugger (WinDbg) can be used to debug kernel and user mode code, analyze crash dumps and to examine the CPU registers as code executes.

WinDbg Preview is a new version of WinDbg with more modern visuals, faster windows, a full-fledged scripting experience, built with the extensible debugger data model front and center. WinDbg Preview is using the same underlying engine as WinDbg today, so all the commands, extensions, and workflows still work as they did before. 

[Download WinDbg Preview from the Microsoft Store](https://microsoft.com/store/p/windbg/9pgjgd53tn86)

If you just need the Debugging Tools for Windows 10, and not WDK 10 or Visual Studio 2017, you can install the debugging tools as a standalone component from Windows SDK. In the installation wizard, select *Debugging Tools for Windows*, and deselect all other components.
