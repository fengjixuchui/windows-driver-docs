# Implementing Printer Driver COM Interfaces





This section explains how to construct a plug-in, based on WDK-supplied sample code. It also explains the calling sequences used for communication between the printer drivers and plug-ins. This section includes the following topics:

[Interface Identifiers for Printer Drivers](interface-identifiers-for-printer-drivers.md)

[Creating the Plug-In](creating-the-plug-in.md)

[Accessing Plug-In Interfaces from Printer Drivers](accessing-plug-in-interfaces-from-printer-drivers.md)
