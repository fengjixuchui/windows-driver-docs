# Calling ScsiPortXxx from HwScsiFindAdapter

Certain **ScsiPort***Xxx* routines can be called *only* from the miniport driver's *HwScsiFindAdapter* routine(s), in particular, the following:

-   [**ScsiPortValidateRange**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/srb/nf-srb-scsiportvalidaterange) to verify that a miniport driver-supplied, bus-relative access range has not already been claimed in the registry by another driver for its device.

-   [**ScsiPortGetDeviceBase**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/srb/nf-srb-scsiportgetdevicebase) to map the (bus-relative) "physical" address range for an HBA to a system-assigned logical address range that the driver can use to communicate with the HBA by calling the **ScsiPortRead***Xxx* and **ScsiPortWrite***Xxx* routines with the mapped logical range addresses.

-   [**ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/srb/nf-srb-scsiportfreedevicebase) to release such a mapped range if *HwScsiFindAdapter* does not find an HBA it can support on a given I/O bus, as indicated by the PORT\_CONFIGURATION\_INFORMATION **SystemIoBusNumber** value.

-   [**ScsiPortGetUncachedExtension**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/srb/nf-srb-scsiportgetuncachedextension) to allocate a DMA buffer shared between the system and a bus-master HBA.

In addition to these four routines, there is one routine that can only be called from the miniport driver's *HwScsiFindAdapter* routine *or* from *HwScsiAdapterControl* when the control type is **ScsiSetRunningConfig**:

-   [**ScsiPortGetBusData**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/srb/nf-srb-scsiportgetbusdata) to get BUS\_DATA\_TYPE-specific configuration information, such as bus-relative device memory (access) ranges, interrupt vector or IRQL, and DMA channel or port.

For more information about these **ScsiPort***Xxx* routines, see [SCSI Port Library Routines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/index).
