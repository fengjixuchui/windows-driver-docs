# Common tasks for USB client drivers


This topic lists the "How to" topics in this documentation set. Each how-to topic presents a set of tasks as a sequence of steps with code examples.

A How to topic provides you with step-by-step instructions about a process related to a USB client driver task. Generally, the topics are written with the assumption that you are extending the drivers created by USB templates included with Microsoft Visual StudioÂ 2012.

This list contains links to the how-to topics for USB client drivers.
