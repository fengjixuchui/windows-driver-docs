# Understanding Windows Update Automatic and Optional Rules for Driver Distribution

This article describes how you can control when Windows Update distributes your driver.

When [submitting a driver to Windows Update](publish-a-driver-to-windows-update.md), the **Driver Delivery Options** section presents two radio buttons: **Automatic** and **Manual**

Under the **Automatic** option there are two checkboxes: **Automatically delivered during Windows Updates** and **Automatically delivered to all applicable systems**. **Automatic** is the default setting for all new shipping labels.

When the first checkbox is selected, the driver is classified as a **Dynamic Update** (a term that applies to *upgrade* scenarios). Windows automatically preloads drivers in this category when upgrading the OS.

When the second checkbox is selected, the driver is downloaded and installed automatically on all applicable systems once it is released. All **Automatic** drivers must first have been evaluated by Microsoft through [Driver Flighting](driver-flighting.md).

For more info about the **Manual** option, see [Publish a driver to Windows Update](publish-a-driver-to-windows-update.md).

## Automatic updates

During a scheduled update or when a user selects **Check for updates** in the **Updates & Security** settings menu, Windows Update distributes only the highest-ranking **Automatic drivers** that apply to the system's devices.

## Optional/Manual updates

In Windows 10, version 1909 and earlier, Windows Update automatically distributes **Optional/Manual** drivers in the following scenarios:
* A device has no applicable drivers available in the Driver Store ("Driver Not Found"), and there is no applicable **Automatic** driver
* Or *if the only locally available driver is generic*, meaning a system-provided driver that provides only basic device functionality, and there is no applicable **Automatic** driver

## Device plug-in ("Plug and Play")

When a device is connected to a Windows system, [Plug and Play (PnP)](../kernel/introduction-to-plug-and-play.md) looks for a compatible driver already available on the computer. If one exists, Windows installs it on the device. Otherwise, Windows searches Windows Update for a compatible driver, first matching the highest-ranking **Automatic** driver on Windows Update.

In Windows 10, version 1909 and earlier, if no **Automatic** driver is available for the device, Windows proceeds to the highest-ranking **Optional/Manual** driver.

Starting in Windows 10, version 2004, Windows does not search for an **Optional/Manual** driver when an **Automatic** driver is not available. To acccess **Optional/Manual** drivers, go to: **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > View optional updates > Driver updates**.

## Device manager

In Windows 10, version 1909 and earlier, when a user searches for updated drivers in Device Manager, Windows attempts to install the highest-ranking driver from Windows Update, regardless of whether it is classified as **Automatic** or **Optional/Manual**.

Starting in Windows 10 version 2004, when a user searches for updated drivers in Device Manager, Windows searches only drivers on the computer. To search online, use the *Windows Update Settings page*.

## Summary

Here's a table that summarizes the information above.

The first column indicates the selection state in the **Driver Delivery Options** section. The first checkbox (**Automatically delivered during Windows Updates**) is indicated by Dynamic Update, and the second (**Automatically delivered to all applicable systems**) is indicated by Regular **Automatic** Update. **Manual** indicates **Optional/Manual** drivers, and Windows Update is abbreviated WU.
