# Adding a Rule


To add a rule to a filter:

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell in the session, and then click **Manage Filters**.

2.  In the **Manage Filters** dialog box, at the bottom of the box, click **New Rule**.

3.  In the **Rule To Be Modified or Added** area, select the [elements of the rule](filter-rule-elements.md).

4.  Click **Add Rule**.

If you are using a [workspace](using-traceview-workspaces.md), you must [resave the workspace](saving-or-resaving-a-workspace.md) after adding the rule. Otherwise, the rule is not added to the workspace.
