# Controlling Color Management





Color management for a printer can be controlled by an application, the system (GDI), the driver, or device hardware. The driver determines which component is managing color correction by examining flags within the [**BRUSHOBJ**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/ns-winddi-brushobj) and [**XLATEOBJ**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/ns-winddi-xlateobj) structures that are passed to its implementations of graphics DDI drawing functions. The following flags are defined:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>BR_DEVICE_ICM in BRUSHOBJ</p>
<p>XO_DEVICE_ICM in XLATEOBJ</p></td>
<td><p>Color management is being performed by the driver or the device.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>BR_HOST_ICM in BRUSHOBJ</p>
<p>XO_HOST_ICM in XLATEOBJ</p></td>
<td><p>Color management is being performed by the application or the system (GDI).</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

The following topics describe driver support for these color management scenarios:

[System Control](system-control.md)

[Driver Control and Device Control](driver-control-and-device-control.md)

[Supporting CMYK Color Space](supporting-cmyk-color-space.md)

[Color Management of JPEG and PNG Images](color-management-of-jpeg-and-png-images.md)
