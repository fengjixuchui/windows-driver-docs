# Closing an Offloaded TCP Connection


\[The TCP chimney offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]

Either the local host stack or the remote host can initiate a disconnect request on an offloaded TCP connection:

-   For more information about responding to a disconnect request that was initiated by the local host stack, see [Responding to a Disconnect Request](responding-to-a-disconnect-request.md).

-   For more information about responding to a disconnect request that was initiated by the remote host, see [Responding to the Reception of a FIN or RST Segment](responding-to-the-reception-of-a-fin-or-rst-segment.md).
