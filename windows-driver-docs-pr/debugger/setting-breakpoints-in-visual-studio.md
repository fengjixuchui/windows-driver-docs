# Setting Breakpoints in Visual Studio

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is not available in WindowsÂ 10, version 1507 and later versions of the WDK.
>


The procedures shown in this topic require that you have the Windows Driver Kit integrated into Visual Studio. To get the integrated environment, first install Microsoft Visual Studio, and then install the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). For more information, see [Windows Driver Development](../index.yml).

You can set, view, and manipulate breakpoints by entering commands in the Debugger Immediate Window. For a list of commands, see [Methods of Controlling Breakpoints](methods-of-controlling-breakpoints.md). If the Debugger Immediate window is not already open, from the **Debug** menu, choose **Windows&gt;Immediate**.
