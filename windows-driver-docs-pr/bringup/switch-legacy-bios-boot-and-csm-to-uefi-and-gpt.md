# Switch Legacy BIOS boot and CSM to UEFI and GPT


Switching between the firmware boot options; Legacy BIOS and UEFI (labeling may be different between firmware), is not required for upgrade. 

It is important to note that when making changes to firmware and file systems, it is possible to introduce complications. 

The recommended scenario is to upgrade the system "as is".
