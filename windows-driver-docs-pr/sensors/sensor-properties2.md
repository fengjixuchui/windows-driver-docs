# Sensor properties


The universal sensor driver model supports the use of properties that characterize the driver that is installed on the Windows device.

Each property is represented by a *property key*, a GUID value that identifies a property category and a property identifier. This topic contains information about the properties that partners can use to identify their sensor driver.

### In this section

|Topic|Description|
|---|---|
|[Common sensor properties](common-sensor-properties.md)|This topic describes the sensor properties that are common for all sensors.|
|[Enumeration properties](enumeration-properties.md)|This topic describes the static sensor properties that are available from the PnP Driver Store.|
|[Other sensor properties](other-sensor-properties.md)|In addition to the [Common sensor properties](common-sensor-properties.md) and the [Enumeration properties](enumeration-properties.md), there are other sensor properties that are specific to certain types of sensors. This section discusses these other properties.|
|[Data field properties](data-field-properties.md)|This topic describes the sensor properties that are used for data fields only.|
