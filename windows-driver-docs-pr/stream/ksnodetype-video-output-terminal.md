# KSNODETYPE\_VIDEO\_OUTPUT\_TERMINAL


This node type is defined in *ksmedia.h*. It may be returned to applications calling the **get\_NodeType** method of the **IKsTopologyInfo** interface. **IKsTopologyInfo** is described in the DirectShow section of the DirectX 9.2 SDK documentation. The **get\_NodeType** reference page describes this node type.

The **IKsTopologyInfo** interface may be used by applications that are communicating with the Microsoft-provided [USB Video Class Driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/usb-video-class-driver) (UVC) class driver. Driver writers do not use this node type.
