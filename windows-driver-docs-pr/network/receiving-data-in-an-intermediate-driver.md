# Receiving Data in an Intermediate Driver





Intermediate drivers receive data at their protocol lower edge in much the same way as protocol drivers.

For more information about managing received network data in intermediate drivers, see [Intermediate Driver Network Data Management](intermediate-driver-network-data-management.md). For more information about receiving data in an NDIS protocol driver, see [Protocol Driver Send and Receive Operations](protocol-driver-send-and-receive-operations.md).

Additional information about receiving data in intermediate drivers is also provided in the following sections:
