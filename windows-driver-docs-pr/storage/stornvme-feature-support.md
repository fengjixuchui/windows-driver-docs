# StorNVMe feature support

The following matrix lists NVME features and indicates the support provided by **StorNVMe** on Windows 10 version 1903 and later versions.

See [Working with NVMe drives](/windows/win32/fileio/working-with-nvme-devices#protocol-specific-queries) for additional information.

Runtime D3 transitions are enabled by default for selected platforms in Modern Stand-by. Host controlled thermal management Get and Set features supported through [IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property) and [IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_PROPERTY](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_set_property), respectively. |
