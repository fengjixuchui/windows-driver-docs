# Surface Coordinates


## <span id="ddk_surface_coordinates_gg"></span><span id="DDK_SURFACE_COORDINATES_GG"></span>


A device surface is a subset of an array of 2²⁸ by 2²⁸ pixels. These pixels are addressed by pairs of 28-bit signed numbers, the upper-leftmost pixel of the device surface is given the coordinates (0,0). The device surface lies in the lower right quadrant of this coordinate space, where both coordinates are nonnegative.
