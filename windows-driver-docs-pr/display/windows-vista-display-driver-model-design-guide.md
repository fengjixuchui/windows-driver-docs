# Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) Design Guide

The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) is available starting with Windows Vista and is required starting with Windows 8. This section discusses requirements, specifications, and behavior for WDDM drivers.

## <span id="wddm_id"></span><span id="WDDM_ID"></span>

**Note**  [Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM)](windows-2000-display-driver-model-design-guide.md) and VGA drivers will not compile on Windows 8 and later versions. If display hardware is attached to a Windows 8 computer without a driver that is certified to support WDDM 1.2 or later, the system defaults to running the Microsoft Basic Display Driver.

The following sections describe the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM):

[What's new for Windows 10 display and graphics drivers](what-s-new-for-windows-10-display-and-graphics-drivers.md)

[What's new for Windows 8.1 display drivers (WDDM 1.3)](what-s-new-for-windows-8-1-display-drivers--wddm-1-3-.md)

[What's new for Windows 8 display drivers (WDDM 1.2)](what-s-new-for-windows-8-display-drivers.md)

[What's new for Windows 7 display drivers (WDDM 1.1)](what-s-new-for-windows-7-display-drivers--wddm-1-1-.md)

[Display Samples](display-samples.md)

[Container Support for non-DX APIs](container-non-dx.md)

**Note**  WDDM drivers do not directly use services of the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) engine; therefore, the [GDI](gdi.md) section is not relevant to writing display drivers for the WDDM driver model.
