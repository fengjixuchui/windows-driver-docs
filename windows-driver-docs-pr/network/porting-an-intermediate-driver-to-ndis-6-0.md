# Porting an Intermediate Driver to NDIS 6.0





This section describes what is required to port an NDIS 5.*x* intermediate driver to NDIS 6.0.

NDIS 6.0 retains backward compatibility with earlier NDIS versions. For more information about backward compatibility, see [NDIS 6.0 Backward Compatibility](ndis-6-0-backward-compatibility.md).

For a summary of NDIS 6.0 intermediate driver porting issues, see [Summary of Changes Required to Port an Intermediate Driver to NDIS 6.0](summary-of-changes-required-to-port-an-intermediate-driver-to-ndis-6-0.md).
