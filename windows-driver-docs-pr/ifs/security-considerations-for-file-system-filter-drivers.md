## <span id="ddk_security_considerations_for_file_system_filter_drivers_if"></span><span id="DDK_SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS_FOR_FILE_SYSTEM_FILTER_DRIVERS_IF"></span>


File system filter drivers have a distinct set of security issues in addition to those that apply to all drivers and to file system specific issues. This section discusses key issues that need to be addressed by file system filter driver writers, although it does not provide a complete list of all possible security issues.

This section includes the following topics:
