# Managing Interrupts





Miniport drivers that manage interrupts for a network interface card (NIC) must register the interrupt and *MiniportXxx* functions for the interrupt.

The following topics provide information about managing interrupt resources and handling interrupts:

[Registering and Deregistering Interrupts](registering-and-deregistering-interrupts.md)

[Handling Interrupts](handling-interrupts.md)

[Synchronizing with Interrupts](synchronizing-with-interrupts.md)

[Interrupt Moderation](interrupt-moderation.md)
