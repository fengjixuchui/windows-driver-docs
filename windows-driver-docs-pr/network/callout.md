# Callout


A *callout* provides functionality that extends the capabilities of the Windows Filtering Platform. A callout consists of a set of [callout functions](callout-function.md) and a GUID key that uniquely identifies the callout. There are several [built-in callouts](./built-in-callout-identifiers.md) that are included with the Windows Filtering Platform. Additional callouts can be added by using [callout drivers](callout-driver.md).
