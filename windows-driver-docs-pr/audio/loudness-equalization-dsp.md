# Loudness Equalization DSP


The loudness equalization DSP ensures that the volume level across different sources of audio signal stays constant. A TV program, for example, might be at just the right volume level whereas the commercial breaks within the program can vary widely in volume. This requires users to adjust the volume setting accordingly. Some of today's expensive HD-capable TVs can equalize volume so that the sound stays at a somewhat constant level. That works well if you rely on your TV for sound playback, but most home theater and home audio enthusiasts connect the TV audio directly to their stereo sound systems. In addition, today's loudness equalization solutions are often not effective for different audio content and sources.

Versions of Windows with this audio effect can maintain a more uniform perceived loudness across different digital audio files or sources than earlier Windows technologies. This means that loudness always stays within a specified range, even for different digital signals.
