# Still Image Device Installers





Microsoft provides a class installer for still image devices, with the following features:

-   WDM PnP detection when a device is installed.

-   Installation wizard for legacy devices connected to parallel and serial ports.

-   Support for special INF file entries (see [INF Files for Still Image Devices](inf-files-for-still-image-devices.md)).

-   Support for vendor-supplied co-installer extensions. For more information, see [Writing a Co-installer](../install/writing-a-co-installer.md).

If necessary, vendors can provide customized installation programs that can be used instead of the Microsoft-supplied class installer.
