# Trace Consumer


*Trace consumers* are applications and tools that receive trace messages from real-time trace sessions and [trace logs](trace-log.md), and format the messages so that they are readable.

[Tracefmt](tracefmt.md) is a trace consumer. [TraceView](traceview.md) is both a [trace controller](trace-controller.md) and a trace consumer.
