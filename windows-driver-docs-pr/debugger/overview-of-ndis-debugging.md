# Overview of NDIS Debugging


The two primary tools for debugging a network driver are debug tracing and the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) extensions. For more information on debug tracing, see [Enabling NDIS Debug Tracing](enabling-ndis-debug-tracing.md). For more information on the NDIS debugging extensions, see [NDIS Extensions](ndis-extensions--ndiskd-dll-.md), which provides a complete list of the extension commands found in the extension module Ndiskd.dll. The extension module appears in the winxp directory.

An additional tool for debugging a network driver is the collection of regular debugging extensions, which are useful for obtaining debugging information. For example, entering [**!stacks 2 ndis!**](-stacks.md) displays all threads in the stack beginning with **ndis!**. This information can be useful for debugging hangs and stalls.

There is also an NDIS-specific bug check code, bug check 0x7C (BUGCODE\_NDIS\_DRIVER). For a complete list of its parameters, see [**Bug Check 0x7C**](bug-check-0x7c--bugcode-ndis-driver.md).

Another useful tool for testing an NDIS driver is NDIS Verifier. For more information, consult the NDIS Verifier topic in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation.
