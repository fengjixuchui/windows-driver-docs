# IPsec Offload Version 2

\[The IPsec Task Offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]




Internet protocol security (IPsec) task offload enables a computer to offload the computation-intensive cryptographic operations of IPsec to IPsec offload-capable network interface cards (NICs). Windows Server 2008 and NDIS 6.1 support IPsec offload version 2 (IPsecOV2), which extends services that are provided in IPsec offload version 1 (IPsecOV1) to provide improved network performance. IPsecOV2 provides support for additional crypto-algorithms, IPv6, and co-existence with large send offload version 2 (LSOv2).
