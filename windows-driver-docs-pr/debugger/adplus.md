# ADPlus


## <span id="ddk_adplus_dtoolq"></span><span id="DDK_ADPLUS_DTOOLQ"></span>


ADPlus V7.0 is a total rewrite of ADPlus. ADPlus V7.0 is written in managed code, which allows us to easily add new features. ADPlus.exe keeps the basic functionality of ADPlus.vbs and adds some additional features. Also, there is a new companion called ADPlusManager, which extends ADPlus to a distributed environment like an HPC computer cluster.
