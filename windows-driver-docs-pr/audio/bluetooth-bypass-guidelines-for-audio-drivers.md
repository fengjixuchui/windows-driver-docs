# Bluetooth Bypass Guidelines for Audio Drivers


The Bluetooth bypass design guidelines presented in this section show audio driver developers how audio data can be rerouted past the Bluetooth host controller interface (HCI) to be processed in system-on-a-chip (SoC) solution.

Support for Bluetooth bypass audio data streaming was introduced with WindowsÂ 8.1.
