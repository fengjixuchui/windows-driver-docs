File system filter drivers that use a per-stream context structure containing a [**FSRTL\_PER\_STREAM\_CONTEXT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547357) structure can take advantage of built-in per-stream context support in Microsoft Windows XP and later. This section covers the following topics:
