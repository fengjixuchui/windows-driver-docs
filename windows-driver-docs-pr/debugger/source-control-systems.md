# Source Control Systems


SrcSrv includes provider modules for Visual SourceSafe (vss.pm), Perforce (p4.pm), Team Foundation Servers (tfn.pm), and Subversion (svn.pm). There is also a Concurrent Versions Systems (CVS) module for use with SrcSrv, but it has not been tested extensively. It is also possible to generate your own modules to support other versions of control systems.

This section includes:

[Using Visual SourceSafe](using-visual-sourcesafe.md)

[Debugging with Visual SourceSafe](debugging-with-visual-sourcesafe.md)

[Using CVS](using-cvs.md)

[Using Other Source Control Systems](using-other-source-control-systems.md)
