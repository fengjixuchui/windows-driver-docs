# Creating a Preview Package


When you create a package, you can submit it for preview only. This allows you to test an experience on client devices, and then change or modify the experience before you release it as a live experience.

Before you submit preview packages, you must first create a PreviewKey that is unique to your company. Only people who know the PreviewKey can download your preview packages.

The process for releasing a preview package is the same as the process for releasing any other package, except that you identify the package as a preview so that your selected users know to use the PreviewKey.

Any preview package submitted by the partner of a company will require the companyâ€™s PreviewKey to be set in a registry key with the following settings:

-   Key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Device Metadata

-   Value Name: DeviceMetadataPreviewKey

-   Value Type: REG\_SZ

-   Value: &lt;Your PreviewKey&gt;

**To create a PreviewKey**

1.  From either the Windows Dev Center or the Hardware Dev Center, sign in to the dashboard with the Microsoft account.

2.  On the left side of the window, click **Device metadata**.

3.  On the **Device metadata** page, under **Manage preview key**, enter a PreviewKey that conforms to the following guidelines:

    -   The PreviewKey must contain between 1 and 15 characters.

    -   The characters must be alphanumeric. In other words, the PreviewKey can include only uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or numbers. The PreviewKey cannot contain special characters.

    -   The PreviewKey must be unlike any other existing PreviewKey.

    -   Only one PreviewKey is allowed for each company.
