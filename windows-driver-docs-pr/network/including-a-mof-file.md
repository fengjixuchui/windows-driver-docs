# Including a MOF File





You must include a description of all of the custom GUIDs that map to a miniport driver's custom OIDs in a managed object format (MOF) file that must be compiled and included in the miniport driver's resource (\*.rc) file.

The MOF source file must be of type MOFDATA and must have an extension of .mof. You must compile the MOF source file into a binary file with [Mofcomp.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/compiling-a-driver-s-mof-file) and must check this file with [Wmimofck.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-wmimofck-exe).

You must insert the following line in the miniport driver's resource file (\*.rc) to include the MOF binary:

```Text
NdisMofResource MOFDATA filename.bmf
```

*FileName* represents the file name of the MOF source file.
