# Integration with Windows





Because the property sheet page is a COM object, it needs to be registered. This can be done by an INF file or through DirectInput's **IDirectInputJoyConfig8** interface. A sample INF file is part of the sample property sheet in the DirectX Driver Development Kit (DDK).

**To register the property sheet page:**

1.  Use the GuidGen tool (which is included in the Microsoft Windows SDK) to create a CLSID for your property sheet (this is the same as the one entered in the **ConfigCLSID** entry mentioned earlier). Remember, this is your device-specific property sheet GUID and it should be the same as the one in your code.

2.  Create a new key in the registry under **My Computer\\HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\CLSID** using this new GUID (it should look something like {B9EA2BE1-E8E9-11D0-9880-00AA0044480F}).

3.  Inside that key, create subkeys named **InProcHandler32** and **InProcServer32**.

4.  Inside the **InProcServer32** key, edit the (default) entry to reflect the location and name of your property sheet DLL.

Your device must also be properly registered as a gaming device. This may be done through DirectInput, or through an INF file.

**To register the device:**

1.  In the registry key **My Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\control\\MediaProperties\\PrivateProperties\\Joystick\\OEM**, enter a key for your device. It is advisable to make this key name the same as your device OEM Name.

2.  Create the following entries:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="33%" />
    <col width="33%" />
    <col width="33%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Key Value</th>
    <th>Key value type</th>
    <th>Key value type contents</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>ConfigCLSID</p></td>
    <td><p>String Value</p></td>
    <td><p>"{your property sheet CLSID}"</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>OEMName</p></td>
    <td><p>String Value</p></td>
    <td><p>"Product name of your device"</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

     

**Note**   These two entries are the minimum you need to get started. Refer to the DirectX DDK for additional information about all of the available entries and their associated services.
