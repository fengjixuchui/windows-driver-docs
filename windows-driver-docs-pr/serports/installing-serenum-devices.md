# Installing Serenum Devices





To install a device that is enumerated by Serenum, use the following [*hardware ID*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556288#wdkgloss-hardware-id) format for the device:

Serenum\\*XxxxYyyy*

Where: *Xxxx* is a field of four ASCII characters that specify the EISA Manufacturing ID; *Yyyy* is a field of four ASCII characters that specify the Product ID. Serenum IDs are documented in the [Plug and Play External COM Device Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/gg463189.aspx).
