# Issuing Commands to Communicate with Devices





A miniport driver with a WDM lower edge that controls devices on a bus issues commands to the bus interface to communicate with those devices. For more information, see [Handling IRPs](../kernel/handling-irps.md) and the documentation for the particular bus-driver interface.
