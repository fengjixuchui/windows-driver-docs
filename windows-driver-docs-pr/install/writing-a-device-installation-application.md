# Writing a Device Installation Application





**Note**  Features described in this section are not supported in universal or mobile driver packages. See [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

 

If your driver package that installs those components. The device installation application and distribution medium should be compatible with AutoRun, so that AutoRun starts the application automatically when a user inserts your distribution medium. For more information about AutoRun, see [Creating an AutoRun-Enabled Application](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/cc144206(v=vs.85)).

For guidelines about how to write a device installation application, see [Guidelines for Writing Device Installation Applications](guidelines-for-writing-device-installation-applications.md).

Your [driver package](driver-packages.md) must handle two situations:

1.  The user plugs in your hardware before inserting your distribution medium. This is commonly referred to as a [hardware-first installation](hardware-first-installation.md).

2.  The user inserts your distribution medium before plugging in your hardware. This is commonly referred to as a [software-first installation](software-first-installation.md).
