# Compliance with IETF RFCs


\[The TCP chimney offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]

This section lists the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) request for comments (RFCs) that are applicable to a TCP chimney-capable network interface card (NIC). Such a NIC is referred to as a task-offload engine (TOE) NIC.

To obtain an IETF RFC, see [IETF Request for Comments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=45661).

This section includes the following topics:

[Required and Suggested TCP/IP Protocol Support](required-and-suggested-tcp-ip-protocol-support.md)

[Possible Future Requirements for TCP Chimney-Capable NICs](possible-future-requirements-for-tcp-chimney-capable-nics.md)

[RFCs of Interest That Are Not Required for TCP Chimney-Capable NICs](rfcs-of-interest-that-are-not-required-for-tcp-chimney-capable-nics.md)

[Obsolete RFCs That Should Not Be Used](obsolete-rfcs-that-should-not-be-used.md)

[Requirements for TCP Chimney NICs for Blind-Reset Attacks](requirements-for-tcp-chimney-nics-for-blind-reset-attacks.md)
