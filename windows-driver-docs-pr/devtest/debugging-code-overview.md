# Debugging Code Overview


## <span id="ddk_debugging_code_overview_tools"></span><span id="DDK_DEBUGGING_CODE_OVERVIEW_TOOLS"></span>


Special debugging routines, macros, and global variables are available for both user-mode and kernel-mode drivers. By using these routines in your driver code, you can send messages to the debugger and set breakpoints to aid in debugging.

This topic includes:

[Conditional Compilation and the Build Environment](conditional-compilation-and-the-build-environment.md)

[Breaking Into the Debugger](breaking-into-the-debugger.md)

[Sending Output to the Debugger](sending-output-to-the-debugger.md)

[Reading and Filtering Debugging Messages](reading-and-filtering-debugging-messages.md)

[Determining if a Debugger is Attached](determining-if-a-debugger-is-attached.md)
