<strong>Note</strong>   For optimal reliability and performance, we recommend using <a href="filter-manager-and-minifilter-driver-architecture.md" data-raw-source="[file system minifilter drivers](filter-manager-and-minifilter-driver-architecture.md)">file system minifilter drivers</a> instead of legacy file system filter drivers. Also, legacy file system filter drivers canâ€™t attach to direct access (DAX) volumes. For more about file system minifilter drivers, see <a href="advantages-of-the-filter-manager-model.md" data-raw-source="[Advantages of the Filter Manager Model](advantages-of-the-filter-manager-model.md)">Advantages of the Filter Manager Model</a>.

File system filter drivers use completion routines that are similar to those used by device drivers. A *completion routine* performs completion processing on an IRP. Any driver routine that passes an IRP down to the next-lower-level driver can optionally register a completion routine for the IRP by calling [**IoSetCompletionRoutine**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iosetcompletionroutine) before calling [**IoCallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iocalldriver).

Every IRP completion routine is defined as follows:

```cpp
NTSTATUS 
(*PIO_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) ( 
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject, 
    IN PIRP Irp, 
    IN PVOID Context 
    ); 
```

Completion routines are called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL, in an arbitrary thread context.

Because they can be called at IRQL DISPATCH\_LEVEL, completion routines cannot call kernel-mode routines that must be called at a lower IRQL, such as [**IoDeleteDevice**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iodeletedevice). For the same reason, any data structures that are used in a completion routine must be allocated from nonpaged pool.
