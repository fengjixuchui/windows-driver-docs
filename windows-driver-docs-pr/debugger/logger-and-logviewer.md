# Logger and LogViewer


## <span id="ddk_logger_and_logviewer_dtoolq"></span><span id="DDK_LOGGER_AND_LOGVIEWER_DTOOLQ"></span>


The *Logger* and *LogViewer* tools provide an alternative to standard user-mode debugging. Logger can monitor the actions of a user-mode target application and record all of its API calls. The resulting information can be displayed in the debugger, saved as a text file, or displayed in a powerful interactive format by the LogViewer tool..
