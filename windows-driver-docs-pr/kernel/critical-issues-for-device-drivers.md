# Critical Issues for Device Drivers


When you develop device drivers, you should consider the following critical issues that are related to dynamic hardware partitioning:

[Changes to the Number of Processors](changes-to-the-number-of-processors.md)

[Changes to the Amount of Physical Memory](changes-to-the-amount-of-physical-memory.md)

[Hot Replace of Partition Units](hot-replace-of-partition-units.md)
