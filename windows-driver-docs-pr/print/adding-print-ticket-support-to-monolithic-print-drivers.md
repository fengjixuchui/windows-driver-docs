# Adding Print Ticket Support to Monolithic Print Drivers


For a monolithic print driver to provide Print Ticket support and support the [Print Ticket and Print Capabilities Technologies](print-ticket-and-print-capabilities-technologies.md), it must implement the [IPrintTicketProvider interface](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff554375(v=vs.85)) and also provide the necessary IClassFactory interface support for the COM-style calling methods used by the print driver. At a minimum, the driver must support the methods of the IPrintTicketProvider interface that are called during the OpenPrinter call in the sequence shown below:

1.  [GetSupportedVersions](getsupportedversions.md)

2.  [BindPrinter](bindprinter.md)

3.  [QueryDeviceNamespace](querydevicenamespace.md)

To complete the support for this interface, the print driver must support the rest of the methods of the IPrintTicketProvider interface:

[GetPrintCapabilities](getprintcapabilities.md)

[ConvertDevModeToPrintTicket](convertdevmodetoprintticket2.md)

[ConvertPrintTicketToDevMode](convertprinttickettodevmode.md)

[ValidatePrintTicket](validateprintticket.md)
