# Receive Segment Coalescing (RSC)


In NDIS 6.30 and later (Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and later), receive segment coalescing (RSC) enables network card miniport drivers to coalesce multiple TCP segments and indicate them as a single coalesced unit (SCU) to the operating system's networking subsystem.

This section includes:
