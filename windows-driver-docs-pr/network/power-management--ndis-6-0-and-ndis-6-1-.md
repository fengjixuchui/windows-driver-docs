# Power Management (NDIS 6.0 and NDIS 6.1)





This section describes the NDIS power management interface that was introduced with Windows XP and NDIS 5.1. This power management interface is supported in the following versions of NDIS:

-   NDIS 5.1 (Windows XP)

-   NDIS 6.0 and later versions of NDIS (Windows Vista and later versions of Windows)

This section describes:

-   The power management services that NDIS provides for NDIS miniport drivers.

-   The miniport driver requirements for supporting power management.

-   How NDIS sets the power policy for a network adapter.

This section includes the following topics:

**Note**  Starting with NDIS 6.20, the NDIS power management interface has been revised and extended. If you are developing NDIS 6.20 miniport drivers that support power management, please review the information in [Power Management (NDIS 6.20 and Later)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/power-management--ndis-6-20-). If you are developing NDIS 6.30 miniport drivers that support power management, please review the information in [Power Management (NDIS 6.30 and Later)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/power-management--ndis-6-30-).
