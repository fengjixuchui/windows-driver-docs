The Windows Hardware Certification Program specifies the requirements for hardware and software to work optimally with Windows. For specific details about the Windows Hardware Certification Program requirements for Bluetooth radios and devices, see [Windows Hardware Certification Requirements and Policies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=317937).

For general information about the Windows Hardware Certification Program, see the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733613) documentation.

For Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, the Windows Hardware Certification Program requires Bluetooth radios to support Bluetooth version 4.0 to qualify for a Windows logo. Updated tests are included in the latest version of the HCK.
