# Opening HID collections


This section describes how a HID Client can communicate with the HID Class driver (HIDClass) to operate the device’s HID collections.

HID Clients can operate in the following modes:

-   Use- Mode Application/Driver
-   Kernel-Mode Driver

The following sections identify how the HID Client can communicate with HIDClass using either mode in the preceding list.

This section describes how user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers operate [HID collections](hid-collections.md).

In general, a user-mode application does the following:

- Calls [device installation functions](/previous-versions/ff541299(v=vs.85)) (**SetupDi***Xxx* functions) to find and identify a HID collection.

- Calls CreateFile to open a file on a HID collection.

- Calls **HidD\_**<em>Xxx</em> HID support routines to obtain a HID collection's [preparsed data](preparsed-data.md) and information about the HID collection.

- Calls ReadFile to read input reports and WriteFile to send output reports.

- Calls **HidP\_**<em>Xxx</em> HID support routines to interpret HID reports.

In general, a kernel-mode driver does the following:

- Finds and identifies a HID collection

  If the driver is a function or filter driver, it is already attached to the collection's device stack. However, if the driver is not attached to the collection's device stack, the driver can [use Plug and Play notification](../kernel/using-pnp-notification.md).

- Uses an [**IRP\_MJ\_CREATE**](../kernel/irp-mj-create.md) request to open the HID collection

- Uses IOCTL\_HID\_*Xxx* requests to obtain the HID collection's preparsed data and information about the HID collection

- Uses [**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](../kernel/irp-mj-read.md) requests to read input reports and [**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](../kernel/irp-mj-write.md) requests to send output reports

- Calls **HidP\_**<em>Xxx</em> HID support routines to interpret HID reports
