# Using Workspaces


## <span id="ddk_using_workspaces_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_USING_WORKSPACES_DBG"></span>


When you exit WinDbg, it saves your session configuration in a *workspace*. A workspace enables you to easily preserve your settings from one session to another. You can also save or clear the workspaces manually, or even use a workspace to save a debugging session that is still in progress.

This section includes the following topics:

[Creating and Opening a Workspace](creating-and-opening-a-workspace.md)

[Workspace Contents](workspace-contents.md)

[Using and Customizing WinDbg Themes](using-and-customizing-windbg-themes.md)
