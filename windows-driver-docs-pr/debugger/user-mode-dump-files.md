# User-Mode Dump Files

This section includes:

- [Varieties of User-Mode Dump Files](#varieties)

- [Creating a User-Mode Dump File](#creating)

For information on analyzing a dump file, see [Analyzing a User-Mode Dump File](analyzing-a-user-mode-dump-file.md).


## <span id="varieties"></span><span id="VARIETIES"></span> Varieties of User-Mode Dump Files

There are several kinds of user-mode crash dump files, but they are divided into two categories:

[Full User-Mode Dumps](#full)

[Minidumps](#minidumps)

The difference between these dump files is one of size. Minidumps are usually more compact, and can be easily sent to an analyst.

**Note**   Much information can be obtained by analyzing a dump file. However, no dump file can provide as much information as actually debugging the crash directly with a debugger.


## <span id="full"></span><span id="FULL"></span>Full User-Mode Dumps

A *full user-mode dump* is the basic user-mode dump file.

This dump file includes the entire memory space of a process, the program's executable image itself, the handle table, and other information that will be useful to the debugger.

It is possible to "shrink" a full user-mode dump file into a minidump. Simply load the dump file into the debugger and then use the [**.dump (Create Dump File)**](-dump--create-dump-file-.md) command to save a new dump file in minidump format.

**Note**   Despite their names, the largest "minidump" file actually contains more information than the full user-mode dump. For example, **.dump /mf** or **.dump /ma** will create a larger and more complete file than **.dump /f**.


In user mode, **.dump /m\[**<em>MiniOptions</em>**\]** is the best choice. The dump files created with this switch can vary in size from very small to very large. By specifying the proper *MiniOptions* you can control exactly what information is included.



## <span id="minidumps"></span><span id="MINIDUMPS"></span>Minidumps

A user-mode dump file that includes only selected parts of the memory associated with a process is called a *minidump*.

The size and contents of a minidump file vary depending on the program being dumped and the application doing the dumping. Sometimes, a minidump file is fairly large and includes the full memory and handle table. Other times, it is much smaller -- for example, it might only contain information about a single thread, or only contain information about modules that are actually referenced in the stack.

The name "minidump" is misleading, because the largest minidump files actually contain more information than the "full" user-mode dump. For example, **.dump /mf** or **.dump /ma** will create a larger and more complete file than **.dump /f**. For this reason, **.dump /m**\[*MiniOptions*\] recommended over **.dump /f** for all user-mode dump file creation.

If you are creating a minidump file with the debugger, you can choose exactly what information to include. A simple **.dump /m** command will include basic information about the loaded modules that make up the target process, thread information, and stack information. This can be modified by using any of the following options:

These options can be combined. For example, the command **.dump /mfiu** can be used to create a fairly large minidump, or the command **.dump /mrR** can be used to create a minidump that preserves the user's privacy. For full syntax details, see [**.dump (Create Dump File)**](-dump--create-dump-file-.md).


## <span id="creating"></span><span id="CREATING"></span>Creating a User-Mode Dump File

There are several different tools that can be used to create a user-mode dump file: CDB, WinDbg, Windows Error Reporting (WER), UserDump, and ADPlus.

For information about creating a user-mode dump file through ADPlus, see [ADPlus](adplus.md).

For information about creating a user-mode dump file through WER, see [Windows Error Reporting](windows-error-reporting.md).

## <span id="cdb-windbg"></span><span id="CDB-WINDBG"></span>CDB and WinDbg


CDB and WinDbg can create user-mode dump files in a variety of ways.

### <span id="creating_a_dump_file_automatically"></span><span id="CREATING_A_DUMP_FILE_AUTOMATICALLY"></span>Creating a Dump File Automatically

When an application error occurs, Windows can respond in several different ways, depending on the postmortem debugging settings. If these settings instruct a debugging tool to create a dump file, a user-mode memory dump file will be created. For more information, see [Enabling Postmortem Debugging](enabling-postmortem-debugging.md).

### <span id="creating_dump_files_while_debugging"></span><span id="CREATING_DUMP_FILES_WHILE_DEBUGGING"></span>Creating Dump Files While Debugging

When CDB or WinDbg is debugging a user-mode application, you can also the [**.dump (Create Dump File)**](-dump--create-dump-file-.md) command to create a dump file.

This command does not cause the target application to terminate. By selecting the proper command options, you can create a minidump file that contains exactly the amount of information you wish.

### <span id="shrinking_an_existing_dump_file"></span><span id="SHRINKING_AN_EXISTING_DUMP_FILE"></span>Shrinking an Existing Dump File

CDB and WinDbg can also be used to *shrink* a dump file. To do this, begin debugging an existing dump file, and then use the **.dump** command to create a dump file of smaller size.


## <span id="userdump"></span><span id="USERDUMP"></span>UserDump

The UserDump tool (Userdump.exe), also known as User-Mode Process Dump, can create user-mode dump files.

UserDump and its documentation are part of the OEM Support Tools package.

For more info and to download these tools, see [How to use the Userdump.exe tool to create a dump file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=241339) and follow the instructions on that page. Additionally, When CDB or WinDbg is debugging a user-mode application, you can also use the [.dump (Create Dump File) command](-dump--create-dump-file-.md) to create a dump file.
