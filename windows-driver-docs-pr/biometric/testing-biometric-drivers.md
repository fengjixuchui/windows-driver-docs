# Testing Biometric Drivers


Microsoft recommends that all drivers run the static analysis tools in the WDK. For more information, see [Analyzing Driver Quality by Using Code Analysis Tools](/windows-hardware/drivers).

Also use the runtime tools, such as the [WDF Verifier Control Application](../devtest/wdf-verifier-control-application.md) and [Application Verifier](../devtest/application-verifier.md).

Download the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733613) for tools to test Windows Biometric Framework driver packages with.
