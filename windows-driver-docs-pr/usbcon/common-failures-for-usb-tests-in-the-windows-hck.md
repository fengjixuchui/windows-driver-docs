# Common failures for USB tests in the Windows HLK


Common failures for USB tests in the Windows HLK.

## DevFund tests for USB


-   Error condition: Device Status Check fails with an error indicating that the MUTT device is not present.

    1.  SuperMUTT is running Winusb.sys or Usbtcd.sys as the driver. You can get the driver and the driver installation package files by installing the [MUTT Software Package](./index.md). For more information, see [Tools in the MUTT software package](mutt-software-package.md).
    2.  Make sure that Device manager shows the hardware ID of the SuperMUTT as "USB\\VID\_045E&PID\_078F". **Note**  PID\_078E is incorrect.
    3.  Make sure that Device manager (**View &gt; Devices by connection**) shows the SuperMUTT enumerated downstream of an xHCI controller.
    4.  In USBView, make sure that the SuperMUTT device is operating at SuperSpeed. **Note**  You can install USBView from the **Install Debugging Tools for Windows package** in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). Alternatively, USBView is installed in the Debuggers folder in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
    5.  Make sure that MUTT firmware is up-to-date. From an elevated prompt run "muttutil -updatefirmware" in the directory where you installed the [MUTT Software Package](./index.md).

    If the issue persists, report the problem with these attachments:
    -   Screenshots of Device Manager and USBView showing items 1-4 in the preceding list.
    -   The output of the [MuttUtil](muttutil.md) command.
-   Error condition: DevFund fails during a simple I/O transfer.
    1.  Go to https://aka.ms/usbtrace and download usbtrace.cmd.
    2.  Use this script to capture driver logs of the event for further investigation.
    3.  Attach all contents of %SystemDrive%\\Windows\Tracing with your bug.
    4.  Save and attach the .hlkx file for the failing tests.
-   Error condition: The MUTT device is connected to the system but the correct drivers are not installed.

    Most likely driver installation failed or the device does not have the latest firmware. Install Winusb.sys or Usbtcd.sys as the driver. You can get the driver and the driver installation package files by installing the [MUTT Software Package](./index.md).
