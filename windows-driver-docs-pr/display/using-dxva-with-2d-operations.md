# Using DXVA with 2D Operations


## <span id="ddk_using_dxva_with_2d_operations_gg"></span><span id="DDK_USING_DXVA_WITH_2D_OPERATIONS_GG"></span>


DirectX 9.0 and later drivers use the D3DDP2OP\_BLT operation code to perform blits between [DirectX Video Acceleration](directx-video-acceleration.md) (DXVA) surfaces. Therefore, if the runtime detects a DirectX 9.0 or later driver, the runtime must call the driver's [**D3dCreateSurfaceEx**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_createsurfaceex) function to create any DXVA (or 2D-only) surface.
