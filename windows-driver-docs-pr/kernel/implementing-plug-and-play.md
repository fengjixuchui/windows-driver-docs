[Adding a PnP Device to a Running System](adding-a-pnp-device-to-a-running-system.md)

[Passing PnP IRPs Down the Device Stack](passing-pnp-irps-down-the-device-stack.md)

[Postponing PnP IRP Processing Until Lower Drivers Finish](postponing-pnp-irp-processing-until-lower-drivers-finish.md)

[Starting a Device](starting-a-device.md)

[Stopping a Device](stopping-a-device.md)

[Removing a Device](removing-a-device.md)
