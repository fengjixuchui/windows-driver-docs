<td><p>MuttUtil performs various tasks on <a href="microsoft-usb-test-tool--mutt--devices.md" data-raw-source="[MUTT devices](microsoft-usb-test-tool--mutt--devices.md)">MUTT devices</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates the firmware of the test devices.</li>
<li>Installs drivers for MUTT devices.</li>
<li>Verifies that the devices are installed without errors.</li>
<li>Changes the operating bus speed of the device.</li>
<li>Configures the device to send a resume wake signal after a specified time period.</li>
<li>For the MUTT Pack, it sets the hub to operate at full or high speed; as a single-TT or multi-TT hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>MuttUtil is embedded in the installation section of the included test scripts to ensure that the test device is properly upgraded to latest firmware. The tool is included in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=617710" data-raw-source="[MUTT Software Package](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=617710)">MUTT Software Package</a>.</p></td>

<td><p>The USBLPM tool monitors the U0/U1/U2/U3 power states of USB 3.0 ports. It can also be used to verify that transitions between U0/U1/U2 occur correctly. In addition, the tool can enable or disable U1 and/or U2 states on all devices in the system.</p></td>

<td><p><a href="usbtcd.md" data-raw-source="[USBTCD](usbtcd.md)">USBTCD</a></p></td>
<td><p>USBTCD is the combination of a user-mode application and kernel-mode driver. The tool performs read and write operations. It initiates control, bulk, isochronous, data transfers of various transfer lengths to and from the test device. For a SuperMUTT device, USBTCD transfers data to streams supported by a bulk endpoint. It can also send the transfer buffer as chained MDLs. In that case, you can specify the number of segments in the transfer buffer.</p></td>
