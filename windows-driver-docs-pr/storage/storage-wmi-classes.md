# Storage management and WMI classes


## <span id="ddk_storage_wmi_classes_kr"></span><span id="DDK_STORAGE_WMI_CLASSES_KR"></span>


This section describes the Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S) requirements and the system-supplied Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes used in the Windows storage architecture. For a discussion of how storage miniport drivers handle WMI classes, see [Handling WMI SRBs in Storage Miniport Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/handling-wmi-srbs-in-storage-miniport-drivers).

Storage Management Providers, SMI-S requirements, and system-supplied WMI classes are in the following categories:
