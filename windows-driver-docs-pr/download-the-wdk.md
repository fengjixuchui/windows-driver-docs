## WDK for Windows 10, version 1903

### ![download icon](images/download-install.png) Step 1: Install Visual Studio 2019

The following editions of Visual Studio 2019 support driver development:

* [Download Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16)
* [Download Visual Studio Professional 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Professional&rel=16)
* [Download Visual Studio Enterprise 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Enterprise&rel=16)

When you install Visual Studio 2019, select the **Desktop development with C++** workload. The Windows 10 Software Development Kit (SDK) is automatically included, and is displayed in the right-hand **Summary** pane. However, the version of the SDK that is compatible with the WDK for Windows 10, version 1903 is not currently the default SDK. To select the correct SDK:

* In **Visual Studio Installer**, on the **Workloads** tab, under **Installation Details**, expand **Universal Windows Platform development**.
* Under **Optional**, select **Windows 10 Preview SDK (10.0.18362.0)**.
* Continue with the install.

If you already have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can install the Windows 10 Preview SDK (10.0.18362.0) by using the **Modify** button in Visual Studio install.

For ARM/ARM64 driver development, choose **Individual components** and under **Compilers, build tools, and runtimes** select **Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM/ARM64**.

For each architecture you intend to build drivers for, install the Spectre mitigated libraries thru Individual Components -> Compilers, build tools, and runtimes -> MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C+ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (v14.21).

* [Download WDK for Windows 10, version 1903](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085767)

New as of 1709 release: The WDK installation will by default install the WDK Visual Studio extension. This must be done in order for WDK VS integration to work.

## Enterprise WDK for Windows 10, version 1903 (EWDK)

The EWDK is a standalone self-contained command-line environment for building drivers. It includes the Visual Studio Build Tools, the SDK, and the WDK.  The latest public version of the EWDK contains Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools 16.0.0.  To get started, mount the ISO and run **LaunchBuildEnv**.
