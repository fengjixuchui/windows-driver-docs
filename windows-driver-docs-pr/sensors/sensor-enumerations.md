# Sensor enumerations


The following enumerations are used to indicate the different states or values of the various sensor features.

## In this section

|Topic|Description|
|---|---|
|PROXIMITY_TYPE|This enumeration represents the type of proximity the proximity sensor can detect.|
|[ACTIVITY_STATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sensorsdef/ne-sensorsdef-activity_state)|This enumeration represents the activity states reported by the activity detection sensor.|
|[PEDOMETER_STEP_TYPE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sensorsdef/ne-sensorsdef-pedometer_step_type)|This enumeration represents the step types reported by the pedometer.|
|[PEDOMETER_STEP_TYPE_COUNT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sensorsdef/ne-sensorsdef-pedometer_step_type_count)|This enumeration represents the number of step types that can be detected by the pedometer.|
|[MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sensorsclassextension/ne-sensorsclassextension-magnetometeraccuracy)|This enumeration represents the accuracy states of the magnetometer.|
|SENSOR_DATA_TYPE|This enumeration describes the data types for supported sensors.|
|[SENSOR_STATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sensorsdef/ne-sensorsdef-sensor_state)|This enumeration represents the valid states of a sensor.|
|SENSOR_TYPE|This enumeration contains values that the client driver uses to describe the sensor types.|
|COORDINATE_AXIS|This enumeration represents the six different directions of a 3-dimensional Euclidian coordinate axis.|
