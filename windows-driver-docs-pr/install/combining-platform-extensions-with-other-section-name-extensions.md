# Combining Platform Extensions with Other Section Name Extensions


An INF file that contains INF *DDInstall* sections with platform extensions can also contain additional per-device sections, such as the required <em>DDInstall</em>**.Services** and optional <em>DDInstall</em>**.HW**, <em>DDInstall</em>**.CoInstallers**, <em>DDInstall</em>**.LogConfigOverride**, and <em>DDInstall</em>**.Interfaces** sections. In cross-operating system and cross-platform INF files, you should specify the appropriate platform extension immediately after the INF-writer-defined section name (for example, <em>install-section-name</em>**.ntx86.HW**).

If a cross-operating system INF file contains decorated <em>install-section-name</em>**.nt**, <em>install-section-name</em>**.ntx86**, <em>install-section-name</em>**.ntia64**, or <em>install-section-name</em>**.ntamd64** sections, it must also have additional parallel decorated and undecorated per-device sections. That is, if the INF file has both *install-section-name* and <em>install-section-name</em>**.nt** sections and it has a *DDInstall*.**HW** section, it must also have a parallel <em>install-section-name</em>**.nt.HW** section (if the device or driver requires a **.HW** section for Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows).

The topics in the [INF File Sections and Directives](inf-file-sections-and-directives.md) section show the **nt**<em>xxx</em>**.HW** extensions as part of the formal syntax statements in the appropriate section references, such as in the following example:

```inf
[install-section-name.HW] | 
[install-section-name.nt.HW] | 
[install-section-name.ntx86.HW] | 
[install-section-name.ntia64.HW] | 
[install-section-name.ntamd64.HW] 
```

Such a formal syntax statement indicates that these extensions are valid alternatives to the basic section. This type of statement does *not* indicate that any INF file that has an <em>install-section-name</em>**.nt.HW** section must also include every other platform-specific <em>install-section-name</em>**.nt**<em>xxx</em>**.HW** section. You can use any subset of these extensions to specify the decorated sections that are required for a particular cross-platform installation.

INF files that contain *install-section-name* platform extensions can also include platform extensions with their [**INF SourceDisksNames section**](inf-sourcedisksnames-section.md) and [**INF SourceDisksFiles section**](inf-sourcedisksfiles-section.md) entries, to specify installation file locations in a platform-specific manner.
