# Using Device Manager to Uninstall Devices and Driver Packages

This page describes how to uninstall a device or driver on Windows 10.

First, open Settings (you can do this using the `Windows+I` keyboard shortcut) and type Remove. Select **Add or remove programs**. If your device appears in the list of programs, select uninstall.

If your device does not appear in the list, click the Start button, type Device Manager, and press Enter.

Then follow these steps:

1. Expand the node that represents the type of device that you want to uninstall, right-click the device entry, and select **Uninstall**.
2. On the **Confirm Device Removal** dialog box, select the **Delete the driver software for this device** option, and select **OK**.
3. When the uninstall process is complete, remove the physical device.

With some devices, the device might continue to function until the system has been restarted.
