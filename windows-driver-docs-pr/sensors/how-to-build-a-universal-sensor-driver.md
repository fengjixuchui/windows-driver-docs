# How to build a universal sensor driver


A *universal sensor driver* is a sensor driver that is developed based on the universal sensor driver model for Windows 10. And the topics in this section show you how to build such a sensor driver.

This universal sensor driver development exercise is based on a development board called [Sharks Cove]( http://firmware.intel.com/projects/sharks-cove-uefi-firmware).

The following topics provide detailed guidance for the tasks that you need to perform:

-   [Set up your development environment](set-up-your-development-environment.md)
-   [Prepare your sensor test board](prepare-your-sensor-test-board.md)
-   [Connect your sensor to the Sharks Cove board](connect-your-sensor-to-the-sharks-cove-board.md)
-   [Write and deploy your universal sensor driver](write-and-deploy-your-universal-sensor-driver.md)
-   [Test your universal sensor driver](test-your-universal-sensor-driver.md)
