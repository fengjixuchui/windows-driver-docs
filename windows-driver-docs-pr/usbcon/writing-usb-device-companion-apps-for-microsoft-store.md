# UWP app for a USB device


The [**Windows.Devices.Usb**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Usb) namespace provides a way for a Windows app to communicate with an external USB device that uses WinUSB (Winusb.sys) as the device driver.

## What are the limitations of the namespace?


You *cannot* use [**Windows.Devices.Usb**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Usb) in these cases:

-   If the device driver is not Winusb.sys.
-   You want to communicate with USB isochronous endpoints of the device.
-   You want to communicate streams of a SuperSpeed bulk endpoint. For those endpoints, the USB Windows Runtime classes for bulk transfers can only send or receive data from the first stream of the endpoint.
-   You allow multiple apps to concurrently access the device.
-   Your USB device is an internal device.
    **Note**  
    The APIs are primarily designed for accessing peripheral devices. The API can also access PC internal USB devices. However access to PC internal USB devices from a UWP app is limited to a privileged app that is explicitly declared by the OEM for that PC.

     

-   The kernel-mode device stack has a filter driver above Winusb.sys.
    **Note**  This scenario is available to privileged apps only.

     

-   Your device has multiple USB configurations, and you want to select a configuration, other than the first. [**Windows.Devices.Usb**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Usb) selects the first configuration by default.
