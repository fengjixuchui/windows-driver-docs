# Core Driver Sample


The Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes a sample INF file that shows the use of core packages, called PackageAware.inf. This sample shows how to use the **PackageAware** keyword to support point and print with packages and how to define a core driver package that other print driver packages can use. This sample also demonstrates how an INF file can support more than one driver architecture.
