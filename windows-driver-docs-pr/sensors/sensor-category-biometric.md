# SENSOR\_CATEGORY\_BIOMETRIC


The SENSOR\_CATEGORY\_BIOMETRIC category contains sensors that provide information about living beings.

## Platform-defined Sensor Types

This category includes the following platform-defined sensor types.

|Sensor type|Meaning|
|--|--|
|SENSOR_TYPE_HUMAN_PRESENCE|Sensors that detect human presence.|
|SENSOR_TYPE_HUMAN_PROXIMITY|Sensors that detect human proximity.|
|SENSOR_TYPE_TOUCH|Touch sensors.|

 

### Platform-defined Data Fields

This category includes the following platform-defined data fields.

|Data type|Type|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_HUMAN_PRESENCE|VT_BOOL|VARIANT_TRUE when a human is using the computer.|
|SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_HUMAN_PROXIMITY_METERS|VT_R4|Distance between a human and the computer, in meters.|
|SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_TOUCH_STATE|VT_BOOL|VARIANT_TRUE when the touch sensor is being touched, otherwise VARIANT_FALSE.|

 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Each platform-defined biometric data type **PROPERTYKEY** is based on a common **GUID** that is named SENSOR\_DATA\_TYPE\_BIOMETRIC\_GUID. As it is a reserved base value, do not use this **GUID** to define your own property keys.
