-sicv |Causes the symbol handler to ignore the CV record
-sins |Causes the debugger to ignore the symbol path and executable image path environment variables.
-snc | Causes the debugger to turn off C++ translation.
-snul | Disables automatic symbol loading for unqualified names.
-sup | Causes the symbol handler to search the public symbol table during every symbol search
-sflags| Sets all the symbol handler options at once.

For general information on the startup parameters, see [WinDbg Command-Line Options](windbg-command-line-options.md).
